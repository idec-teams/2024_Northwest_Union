    <h2>The alignment between the project and SDGs </h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>SDG1:No Poverty </h3>
    <p>Indirect contribution: Poverty has multiple dimensions of causes, including unemployment, social exclusion, and the vulnerability of certain populations to disasters, diseases, and other phenomena that prevent them from engaging in productive activities.  Although the direct goal of the project is not to eradicate poverty, by improving public health, especially reducing the risk of poverty caused by health problems such as cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, it indirectly helps to reduce the phenomenon of poverty caused by illness and returning to poverty due to illness, thus having a positive impact on achieving the goal of poverty free. </p>
    <img class="rounded mx-auto d-block" src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5161/sustainability/image12.webp" alt="picture-3">
    <h3>SDG3:Good Health and Well-being</h3>
    <p> Direct contribution: In April 2016, the World Health Organization released Global diabetes Report, calling for action to reduce the exposure to known risk factors of type 2 diabetes, and improve the access to care and the quality of care for all forms of diabetes patients.  All types of diabetes cause complications in many parts of the body and increase the overall risk of premature death.  Possible complications include heart attack, stroke, renal failure, leg amputation (due to infection with unhealed foot ulcers), vision loss, and nerve damage.  The project directly aims at health problems, reduces the cholesterol level through innovative health products, reduces the risk of diabetes, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases and other diseases, directly promotes the health and well-being of the public, and is highly compatible with SDG 3.</p>
    <img class="rounded mx-auto d-block" src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5161/sustainability/image13.webp" alt="picture-4">
    <h3>SDG4：Quality Education </h3>
    <p> Indirect contribution: Although the project itself does not directly involve the field of education, it indirectly supports the realization of high-quality education by improving public health levels and reducing educational interruptions or quality decline caused by health issues (such as absenteeism due to illness, decreased learning ability, etc.).  In addition, we actively carry out activities to popularize health knowledge, and the public's demand for health education will also increase, promoting the investment and development of relevant educational resources.  We mainly carry out educational practices in multiple locations within Gansu Province, including Lanzhou City, Tianshui City, and Zhouqu County.  The practice includes questionnaire survey to assess the public's awareness of type 2 diabetes, making brochures for different age groups to popularize diabetes knowledge, and carry out free clinic activities in Zhouqu County to screen and consult diabetes.  At the same time, health education activities were organized in the community, especially to popularize diabetes prevention knowledge among young people, and encourage children to participate in indoor sports to promote a healthy lifestyle.  In addition, we also promote educational activities through integrated media centers to increase social attention.</p>
    <img class="rounded mx-auto d-block" src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5161/sustainability/image14.webp" alt="picture-5">
    <h3>SDG5：Gender Equality </h3>
    <p>Potential contribution: Although the project primarily focuses on the health sector, gender equality is equally important in the health field.  Ensuring equal access to health services and medical resources for both men and women is a factor we need to consider in our promotion process.  By providing gender neutral health solutions, the project helps promote the achievement of gender equality goals. </p>
    <img class="rounded mx-auto d-block" src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5161/sustainability/image15.webp" alt="picture-6">
  <h3>SDG10：Reduced Inequalities</h3>
  <p>Indirect contribution: By improving public health, especially focusing on the health needs of vulnerable groups such as low-income individuals and residents in remote areas, we can reduce inequalities caused by health issues in various aspects such as accessing medical resources, disease prevention and treatment, improving health literacy, social integration and mental health, and reducing economic burden. </p>
  <img class="rounded mx-auto d-block" src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5161/sustainability/image16.webp" alt="picture-7">
  <h3>SDG17：Partnerships for the Goals  </h3>
  <p>Important means: The successful implementation of the project requires cooperation and support from multiple parties such as the government, enterprises, research institutions, and non-governmental organizations.  Establishing extensive partnerships, sharing resources, technology, and experience, and jointly promoting the implementation of projects and achieving goals is the key to sustainable development of projects.  The First Hospital of Lanzhou University will provide us with tremendous support in product sales and work closely with doctors in relevant departments to provide more professional technical guidance in clinical applications.  In addition, we will contact pharmaceutical wholesalers and collaborate with online pharmacies.  </p>

    <h2>The profound significance of sustainable development in the project</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Health aspect: </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h4>Improving public health: </h4>
        <p>We have improved the quality of life and reduced health problems caused by high cholesterol for patients who cannot be treated with traditional medicine or consume high-fat foods by providing a safe and effective cholesterol management plan.  We are committed to reducing the incidence rate of diseases related to glucose metabolism and lipid metabolism, which is one of the major causes of death worldwide.  By controlling cholesterol levels, this project helps alleviate the burden on the healthcare system and improve public health standards. </p>

      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Personalized healthcare: </h4>
        <p> The regulation products of gut microbiota can be customized according to the individual's microbiome and metabolic status to meet the personalized needs of different patients.  Through personalized treatment, the effectiveness of treatment and patient compliance can be improved. 

        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Economic aspect : </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h4>The market potential is enormous: </h4>
        <p>The World Health Organization points out that cardiovascular disease is a major cause of death worldwide, estimated to claim 17.9 million lives annually.  In addition, the number of patients with diabetes increased from 108 million in 1980 to 422 million in 2014.  The impact of behavioral risk factors may manifest in individuals as elevated blood pressure, blood sugar, and blood lipids, as well as overweight and obesity.  The increasing demand for patients with sugar metabolism and lipid metabolism related diseases has also driven the development of the intestinal engineering bacteria product market.  More and more health management agencies, medical institutions, and biotechnology companies are launching intestinal engineering bacteria products targeted at this patient population.  These products cover multiple aspects, from probiotics and prebiotics to customized microbiome modulation schemes, to meet the needs of different patients. </p>

      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Promote industrial upgrading: </h4>
        <p>The successful implementation of the project will promote the application of intestinal engineering bacteria products in the field of health products, and facilitate the upgrading and development of related industrial chains.  At the same time, the research and production of the project will drive employment, increase local tax revenue, and have a positive impact on the local economy. </p>
