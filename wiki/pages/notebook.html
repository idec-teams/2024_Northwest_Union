    <h2>April</h2>
    <p>Initial thoughts are established, and preliminary experimental design is underway.  <br>
      Suitable target genes will be selected, along with appropriate chassis organisms and types of transformation plasmids.
      </p>
    <hr>

    <h2>May</h2>
    <p>Synthesize the gene and construct recombinant plasmids.</p>
    <hr>

    <h2>June</h2>
    <p>Prepare competent cells. Cultivate bacterial cultures and extract plasmids, followed by the transformation of the target gene into the chassis organism, Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (ECN1917). Synthesize DLPC-encapsulated engineered bacteria.</p>

    <h2>July</h2>
    <p>Verification of the functions of GLP-1 and BCoAT genes includes the following steps: Protein concentration in the supernatant will be measured using the BCA protein assay kit. For the determination of secreted proteins, the supernatant will be filtered through a 0.22 Âµm membrane. The expression of secreted proteins will be quantified according to the instructions of the GLP-1 ELISA kit. For Western blot analysis, log-phase bacterial cultures will be collected and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 minutes. The supernatant will be collected and precipitated for colony counting. Using anti-His and anti-Flag antibodies, Western blotting will be performed to detect the negative control group, positive control group, the transformed internal reference gene protein BCoAT, and the expression of recombinant GLP-1 protein.</p>
    <hr>

    <h2>August</h2>
    <p>Assess bacterial viability using the CCK-8 assay and the DMAO/PI staining method for evaluating bacterial activity and cell death.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>September</h2>
    <p>Utilize transmission electron microscopy to observe DLPC-encapsulated engineered bacteria.</p>
    <hr>

    <h2>Others</h2>
    <p>Our division of labor schedule.</p>
