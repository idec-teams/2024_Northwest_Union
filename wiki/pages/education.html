    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <hr>
    <p> Countless examples demonstrate that receiving a good education is crucial for a brighter future. This principle applies not only to individuals but also to countries and communities. Our alma mater, Lanzhou University, is situated in northwestern China, an area characterized by a relatively desolate environment and an economic development level that pales in comparison to more prosperous regions such as Shanghai or Guangdong. Additionally, our inland location results in limited transportation options. These factors contribute to a less than satisfactory level of educational development here. In the context of globalization, coastal regions are flourishing, while our inland area appears to have a bleak outlook. It seems our university has little hope of reclaiming its status as one of China's top ten institutions. Our circumstances and the resources available to us mirror those of individuals from other inland regions and countries. In a global landscape that thrives on maritime trade, people from inland areas struggle to access the same resources as those in coastal regions across various domains, including economics, trade, technology, and education. </p>
    <p>One fateful night, in the quiet corridors of our educational journey, a conversation unfolded that would alter the course of our lives:

    </p>
    <p>“Is there an inherent barrier for people from inland regions when it comes to education, compared to those from coastal areas? Does having fewer resources make it harder for us, as inland dwellers, to succeed?” a team member mused, his voice filled with frustration.

    </p>
    <p>Another replied, “Perhaps we don’t always need to chase the highest honors. We can become our own role models through hard work, carve out our unique identities, and set an example in our region. While we may not be able to provide more people with access to high-quality educational resources, by developing a full range of educational activities aimed at the widest possible audience. That is already a meaningful contribution!”

    </p>
    <p>Thus, we decided to embark on a comprehensive science popularization journey. We believe that the dissemination of scientific knowledge should be inclusive, targeting all age groups and reaching as many people as possible.

    </p>
    <p>Our journey spans four distinct levels: schools, communities and cities, the nation, and the globe, each presenting unique challenges and opportunities. At the school level, we focused on two specific age groups: children and elementary school students, university students.

    </p>
    <img alt="picture-add" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" src="{{ url_for('static', filename = 'education/edu-add.png') }}">


    <p>In schools, we organized fun science games for children, laboratory tours, scientific conferences for university students, and slide painting activities. These initiatives captivated young minds and encouraged the artistic expression of complex scientific concepts.

    </p>
    <p>In Lanzhou, Gansu Province, we collaborated with community service centers and hospitals to host science popularization activities for audiences of all ages, primarily featuring engaging games and informative presentations.

    </p>
    <p>On a national scale, we tailored educational programs to address regional disparities and distributed printed cancer science handbooks across the country.

    </p>
    <p>Globally, we developed and disseminated multilingual cancer knowledge handbooks, shared science articles on WeChat public accounts, and created a manual advocating for educational equity. We are committed to ensuring that the dissemination of scientific knowledge faces no barriers, whether related to national borders, natural conditions, age, or gender.

    </p>
    <p>By adopting a precision-oriented approach, we have ensured that everyone—regardless of age, ethnicity, gender, or background—can access scientific knowledge. We successfully integrated art and science, conducting educational activities in engaging ways that unite hearts and minds around the world.

    <h2>Our view of education </h2>
    <hr>
    <p> 
      In the vision of our team, education has been endowed with a more profound and rich connotation, which goes far beyond the level of simple knowledge indoctrination and skill teaching, and becomes a profound spiritual journey and a feast of wisdom awakening. We firmly believe that the true meaning of education, as the French Enlightenment thinker Rousseau-put it, is not only to sow the seeds of knowledge in the hearts of students, but also to ignite their inner flame of exploring the unknown and pursuing the truth, leading them to embark on an extraordinary journey of self-discovery and growth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chinese sage Lao Zi once said, "It is better to teach people to fish than to teach them to fish." As a group of explorers with scientific dreams and educational enthusiasm, we are committed to building an open, inclusive and innovative learning environment, so that every student can breathe freely on this fertile soil and explore bravingly. We believe that the power of education lies in inspiring students' own learning potential. Through the project-driven learning model, students are encouraged to think independently, practice, and combine theoretical knowledge with practical problems, so as to deepen understanding in practice, sharpen their will in challenges, and learn to communicate and collaborate in cooperation.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the platform of iDEC, we encourage students to have the courage to question and challenge authority, and guide every member to pay attention to social hotspots, think about science and technology ethics, examine the world from a scientific perspective, and warm people's hearts with humanistic feelings. In various community activities, we apply the knowledge we have learned to help others, not only helping the residents of the community, but also educating each team member themselves. Because we attach great importance to spiritual touch and enlightenment, the ultimate goal of education is to cultivate future leaders who are capable of independent thinking, social responsibility and humanistic care. We believe that such education can cultivate interdisciplinary talents with both profound scientific literacy and noble moral sentiments, so as to contribute to the progress and development of society.
    </p>
    <p>
      To sum up, iDEC team's viewpoint and purpose in education is to pay more attention to the enlightenment of mind and the awakening of wisdom while imbuing knowledge. Through innovative education methods, students' inner motivation is stimulated, and they are trained to become new era youth with innovative spirit, practical ability, social responsibility and humanistic care. We firmly believe that this kind of education is the true sense of education, which can not only illuminate the future of students, but also illuminate the direction of human civilization.

      Northwest Union Pioneers the Journey of Biomedicine Cinema
      </h3>
      <p>
        In the academic palace of the university, innovation and humanistic care always go hand in hand. Northwest Union with its unique perspective and full of enthusiasm, in the university campus carefully planned a special film viewing activities, the selected film is a profound reflection of social reality and the brilliance of human nature - "I am not the God of Medicine". The event was not only a visual and emotional feast, but also inspired students to think deeply about the potential of biomedicine, especially synthetic biology in new drug research and development.
        
        </p>
   <p>
    On the day of the activity, as the night fell, a spacious and bright lecture hall was full of seats, and the students waited with great expectation for the beginning of the film. The film "I Am Not the God of Medicine" slowly opened the prologue with its true and shocking story. In the film, the protagonist changes from an ordinary small vendor to a "god of medicine". His every step of choice touches the heartstrings of the audience, especially the image of the patients who are struggling on the edge of life and death due to the pain and suffering, which makes everyone present feel empathy and compassion.
    </p>     
<img alt="picture-13" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" src="{{ url_for('static', filename = 'education/image13.webp') }}">

<p>During the film, the students were sometimes silent and sometimes sobbing, deeply touched by the doctor-patient relationship and the high price of drugs and other social problems shown in the film. At the end of the film, there was a brief silence, followed by a burst of applause, which was both a recognition of the film and a tribute to the indomitable spirit of its characters.

</p>
<p>
  In the subsequent exchange session, members of the Northwest Union guided everyone to conduct in-depth discussions from the perspective of biomedicine. Many students said that after watching the movie, they had a deeper understanding and sympathy for the suffering of the patients in the face of the disease, and also realized that as young students who may be devoted to scientific research in the future, they shoulder an important mission and responsibility.
  
  </p>
  <p>
    "I hope that in the future, through the method of synthetic biology, more high-quality and inexpensive new drugs can be developed, and there are many more innovative treatments that can be proposed, so that every patient can receive timely and effective treatment, and no longer fall into despair because of high drug costs." A classmate's words are powerful and speak for many people. Other students also responded and expressed their willingness to translate this compassion and responsibility into practical actions, strive to learn professional knowledge, and contribute to the development of biomedicine.
    </p>

<p>
  This movie-watching activity not only gave students a more intuitive and profound understanding of the field of biomedicine, but more importantly, inspired their inner enthusiasm and dreams. As the theme of this activity implies -- Compassion, Innovation and Togetherness, the Northwest Union team is putting these ideas into practice with practical actions. We are leading more young students to move forward in the vast world of biomedicine and contribute to the cause of human health together.

      <p>
        On this warm and bright afternoon, the team members of Northwest Union from Lanzhou University embarked on a journey to the local nursing home with enthusiasm and awe for science. Their purpose is not only to explore the unknown as future pioneers of scientific research, but also to spread the light of knowledge to every corner of society, especially those who need more care and help.
        </p>
        <p>
          The team members are well aware that the elderly population faces many health challenges as they age. As a common chronic disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) seriously affects the quality of life of the elderly. Therefore, the team decided to use their professional knowledge to bring a special health talk to the elderly in the nursing home. The theme was "Recognize and prevent type 2 diabetes".
          </p>
       <p>
        Upon arrival at the nursing home, the team members were warmly welcomed by the elderly. They quickly set up the venue, using a warm and technological environment to create a relaxed and happy learning atmosphere. Before the lecture began, the team members first introduced the basic concepts, causes and harms of diabetes to the elderly through a vivid and interesting animated video, making the otherwise boring knowledge easy to understand and accept.
        
        </p>   
      <p>
        Then, the team members took turns on the stage and explained the prevention strategies of type 2 diabetes in simple language. From the importance of a balanced diet, to the benefits of moderate exercise; From the need to monitor blood sugar regularly, to the positive effects of keeping a good mind, every detail is carefully explained and demonstrated. To enhance the interactivity, they also designed simple question-and-answer sessions and prepared small gifts as rewards to encourage the active participation of the elderly, and the atmosphere was warm and warm.
        </p>  
<img alt="picture-32" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" src="{{ url_for('static', filename = 'education/image32.webp') }}">
<p>
  After the lecture, many elderly people said that they benefited a lot. They not only learned a lot of practical health knowledge, but also felt the care and warmth from the young people. "Such an activity is really meaningful!" An old woman said with emotion, "Before we knew little about diabetes, we always felt it was something far away from us. Now after listening to your explanation, I know the importance of prevention. We must pay more attention to our diet and living habits in the future."
  </p>
  <p>
    This activity not only enabled the elderly people in the nursing home to gain health knowledge, but also made the members of the Northwest Union deeply understand the significance of social responsibility and responsibility. They realized that as future researchers, in addition to pursuing excellence in the professional field, they should also give back what they have learned to the society and contribute to the health and well-being of mankind with the power of science and technology.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the future, Northwest Union will continue to uphold this original intention, illuminate the lives of more people with the light of knowledge, and let love and health go hand in hand.
      </p>
    <h2>The nation</h2>
    <hr>
      <h3>Diabetes knowledge street visits and appeals</h3>
      <p>First, we conducted street interviews to gather information about the public's understanding of diabetes.</p>
<img alt="picture-33" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" src="{{ url_for('static', filename = 'education/image33.webp') }}">
<p>However, through these interviews, we found that the general public's knowledge of diabetes is still very limited, with many people not being aware of its symptoms at all. Therefore, we drafted a corresponding advocacy letter. While providing the public with information related to diabetes, we also urge more people to take appropriate preventive measures.</p>

  <p>Through comparative analysis, we found that there were significant differences in the proportion of carbohydrates, fat, protein and other nutrients in food habits in different regions, which directly affected people's blood glucose levels and the incidence of type 2 diabetes. For example, high sugar and high fat dietary patterns in some regions increase the risk of type 2 diabetes, while diets rich in dietary fiber and low in sugar and fat can help prevent and control the disease.

  </p>
  <h4>Scientific guidance to promote healthy diets</h4>
  <p>Based on these findings, we worked with Thai nutritionists to come up with recommendations on healthy eating for the population in different regions. We emphasize that through scientific and reasonable diet matching, the incidence of type 2 diabetes can be effectively reduced and people's quality of life can be improved. At the same time, we also call on countries around the world to strengthen cooperation and exchanges in the field of diet and health, and jointly promote the development of global health.

  </p>
  <h4>Looking forward to the future, we need to deepen cooperation</h4>
<p>This cross-border exchange not only enhanced our understanding of the relationship between global food habits and type 2 diabetes, but also provided valuable ideas and directions for our future cooperation and research. We look forward to establishing contacts with experts and scholars from more countries and regions, exploring the mysteries of diet and health together, and contributing wisdom and strength to the health and well-being of people around the world.</p>  
<p>Through this series of communication activities, we have deeply recognized the importance of healthy diet for the prevention and control of type 2 diabetes. In the future, we will continue to devote ourselves to the research and promotion of related fields, and contribute to the construction of a healthier and harmonious social environment.

<h3>The Northwest Union shines in the Synthetic Biology exchange Forum: Innovative solutions lead to new perspectives in the treatment of T2DM</h3>
<p>Recently, at the China Synthetic Biology Forum, our team was in the spotlight, introducing our latest progress in exploring new strategies for the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) using synthetic biology technology to experts and colleagues from all over China and the world. This experience not only allowed our team's scientific research achievements to be widely recognized, but also inspired us to have unlimited vision for future research.</p>
<p>At the meeting, our team introduced in detail how to find the unique physiological characteristics of T2DM patients, "faster metabolism time and shorter blood glucose maintenance time", through in-depth study of human metabolic mechanism. Based on this finding, we put forward an innovative idea: although traditional drug therapy such as metformin and sulfonylureas can effectively control blood glucose, frequent use of them may increase the risk of chronic inflammation. Therefore, we aim to develop a personalized treatment based on synthetic biology, aiming to fundamentally improve the health of T2DM patients by regulating their lifestyle and gut environment.</p>
<p>Our speech was highly appraised by the teachers at the forum. They said that the research ideas of our team were novel and unique, which opened up a new path for the treatment of T2DM. A senior professor praised: "Your work not only shows the great potential of synthetic biology, but also shows the deep concern for the quality of life of patients, which is very valuable."</p>
<img alt="picture-51" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" src="{{ url_for('static', filename = 'education/image52.webp') }}">
<p>In addition to gaining valuable recognition, we also made full use of the opportunity of this forum to have in-depth exchanges and discussions with other teams. In a relaxed and pleasant atmosphere, we shared our research progress, challenges and solutions. These exchanges not only broadened our perspective, but also allowed us to see the diversity and creativity of different teams solving the same problem.</p>
<p>In particular, our team has also actively established outreach relationships with other teams, which has laid a solid foundation for subsequent collaborative research. We believe that through interdisciplinary communication and cooperation, we can jointly promote the development of synthetic biology and bring hope to the treatment of more diseases.</p>
<img alt="picture-52" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" src="{{ url_for('static', filename = 'education/image53.webp') }}">
<p>This synthetic Biology exchange forum is not only a demonstration of our team's research achievements, but also a valuable learning and growth experience. We will take this as an opportunity to continue to deepen the field of synthetic biology and explore new methods and approaches for the treatment of T2DM, so as to contribute our wisdom and strength to the cause of human health.
