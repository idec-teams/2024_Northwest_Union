    <h2>overview：</h2>
    <p>We have mobilized all the resources available to our entire team through collaborations both within the campus and beyond. This includes partnering with student organizations, various academic departments, the official school administration, as well as inter-school collaborations. In the broader community, we have established extensive partnerships with social organizations, institutions, healthcare facilities, communities, corporations, and government agencies to fulfill our commitment to making the world a better place to the greatest extent possible.</p>

    <li>
      <h3>1. Co-authored the E. coliNissle1917 white paper with eight universities</h3>
      <p>Our team worked with eight Chinese IGEM teams, including PekingHSC and NJTech- China, to introduce in detail the use history, application scenarios, biosafety and market development prospects of EcN (Escherichia coli Nissle 1917). It provides a reliable reference for the general public and related practitioners.</p>

      <h3>2. Participated in the 11th Conference of China iGEMer Community (hereinafter referred to as CCiC)</h3>
      <p>The Conference of China iGEMer Community is a national exchange meeting independently initiated by the Chinese iGEM participating teams, aiming to provide a platform for the participating iGEM teams and Chinese synthetic biology young enthusiasts to share resources and promote mutual learning and exchanges. This year, our team travelled to Suzhou to participate in the CCIC conference organized by Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University with the theme of "SynBio Nexus".</p>

      <h3>3.lzu&suct</h3>
      <p>Members of the Hp group traveled to Shenzhen, the technological innovation center of China, whose advantageous geographical location provides an excellent platform for academic exchange. The synthetic biology team from Lanzhou University and the relevant research teams from Southern University of Science and Technology are both organizations with extensive research experience in this field. We engaged in discussions on specific technical issues, such as gene synthesis technology, synthetic pathway design, and the development of engineered microorganisms. We exchanged experimental techniques, including methods such as high-throughput screening and metabolic flux analysis. We organized roundtable discussions to facilitate in-depth exploration of specific research questions, and we visited each other’s laboratories to deepen our understanding of the projects.</p>

      <h3>4．SynBio Challenges</h3>
      <p>The Third Synthetic Biology Innovation Competition, hosted by the Synthetic Biology Branch of the Chinese Society for Biotechnology and jointly organized by the Synthetic Biology Institute of Shenzhen Institute of Technology, the Synthetic Biology Research Institute of Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen Synthetic Biology Innovation Institute, Shenzhen Synthetic Biology Association, and Shenzhen Engineering Biology Industry Innovation Center, was successfully held from August 8th to August 9th.</p>
      <p>We, along with other teams, shared our latest research achievements and project progress in the field of synthetic biology, discussing methodologies for experimental design, data analysis, and result interpretation. We exchanged insights with numerous participants on various technologies and tools employed in synthetic biology experiments, encompassing gene editing technologies (such as CRISPR), synthetic genomics, metabolic engineering, among others. Through sharing diverse project cases, our team garnered fresh inspiration, potentially leading to the introduction of new concepts or methodologies in our own research endeavors.</p>

      <h3>5.Lzu&buct</h3>
      <p>On the Biosyn Bridge platform at BUCT, our goal is to enhance the interactivity and impact of our projects through video educational resources. We have uploaded two types of videos: promotional videos and educational videos, aiming to better convey our project concepts and objectives.</p>
      <p>The videos we uploaded primarily showcase our project's background, goals, and core values, with the intention of attracting more attention and participation. Through vivid visual effects and clear messaging, we aspire to provide viewers with a deeper understanding of our project.</p>
      <p>The educational videos cover topics related to our project, encompassing technologies, methodologies, and practical case studies. These videos aim to equip viewers with relevant knowledge, enhancing their skills and comprehension.</p>
      <p>This experience has not only elevated the quality of our project but also provided growth and development opportunities for every participant. We look forward to continuing our exploration and innovation on this platform, jointly advancing the sharing of education and knowledge.</p>
