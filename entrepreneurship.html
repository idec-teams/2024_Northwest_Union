    <h2>1. Project budding: Insight into new health needs</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>In the fast-paced modern life, however, the problems in the field of health are gradually emerging, especially
      the widespread spread of abnormal blood lipids and glycemia in the Chinese population, which has constituted a
      public health problem that cannot be ignored, and urgently needs us to actively respond with innovative product
      solutions. With increasing awareness of health, cardiovascular disease has become a major public health issue of
      global concern. Among them, high cholesterol and high blood sugar is an important risk factor for cardiovascular
      disease, and its management and control have become the focus of public attention. It is in this context that our
      team has keenly captured the urgent market need for an innovative product that can effectively help reduce
      cholesterol, prevent diabetes, and promote cardiovascular health. Thus, the "SugarGuardian" project emerged.</p>

    <h2>2. Concept formation: science and technology integration and health</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>We know that relying on traditional dietary adjustments or medication alone has some effect in lowering
      cholesterol, but it is often accompanied by many inconveniences and limitations. For example, some drugs may be
      accompanied by side effects such as liver or kidney damage and hypoglycemia, posing new health risks to patients.
      Therefore, we put forward the research and development concept of "science and technology integration and health",
      aiming to develop a healthy probiotic product integrating convenience, efficiency and safety through modern
      scientific and technological means, to help users easily manage cholesterol and blood sugar levels and enjoy a
      healthier lifestyle.</p>

    <h2>3. Market research: precise positioning, seize opportunities</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>After determining the direction of the project, we conducted in-depth market research. Through data analysis,
      questionnaire survey, expert interview and other methods, we understand that although there are some
      cholesterol-lowering products in the current market, most of them have problems such as insignificant effect,
      inconvenient use or large side effects. At the same time, with the upgrading of the concept of health consumption,
      consumers demand for high-quality and high-tech health products is increasing. This provides a broad market space
      and unlimited development potential for our project.</p>

    <h2>4. Product conception: innovation leads, science and technology enables</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Based on the market research results, we have preliminarily conceived a new intestinal engineering bacteria
      product integrating intelligent monitoring, personalized dietary advice, scientific exercise guidance and natural
      ingredients assistance.</p>
    <p>Metabolic syndrome is a group of interrelated metabolic disorders, including hypertension, insulin resistance,
      visceral obesity, reduced HDL cholesterol, and elevated triglyceride levels. Numerous clinical studies have shown
      that the intestinal microbiota is an important pathogenic factor affecting the metabolic syndrome. In 2004, the
      Jeffrey Gordon team at the University of Washington found that normal microflora mice had 40 percent higher body
      fat than germ-free mice. Since then, the altered intestinal flora caused by a high-fat diet has led to an increase
      in the proportion of intestinal bacteria containing lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the gut, which is associated with
      an increased risk of hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia. However, a healthy intestinal flora is also protective
      against metabolic disorders. For example, transfer of the fecal flora of healthy individuals to the gut of
      patients with metabolic syndrome by duodenal catheterization can alter their gut microbiota and improve their
      insulin sensitivity. And animal studies have shown that certain strains, such as mucin ackermania, can improve
      diet-induced obesity, fasting blood glucose, and adipose tissue metabolism.
      Human studies have shown that the gut flora is tightly associated with lipid profiles: individuals with low gene
      richness are more likely to develop insulin resistance, high triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein
      cholesterol levels. Similarly, these individuals were also associated with high serum leptin, high triglycerides,
      and high free fatty acids, whereas serum adiponectin and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were lower.
      Intestinal bacterial richness was negatively correlated with BMI and triglyceride levels and positively correlated
      with HDL. Specific intestinal bacteria such as Clostridiaceae were reported to have an association with lipid
      levels or BMI.
      Through the above literature data, we found that the intestinal microflora plays an important role in metabolic
      disorders. Therefore, we further reviewed the literature to study the way that intestinal microbiota regulates
      host lipid metabolism. After the study was found that:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>4.1 </h3> The gut microbiota regulates host lipid metabolism by affecting bile acid composition and bile
        acid receptor signaling. Bile acids, a key component of bile, are synthesized by the liver and stored in the
        gallbladder and later released into the intestine. It mainly emulsifies dietary fat and promotes triglyceride
        decomposition by lipase. In addition, bile acids also function as signaling molecules involved in glucose and
        lipid metabolism. Primary bile acids are synthesized by hepatocytes from cholesterol and converted into
        secondary bile acids by specific enzyme treatment. Thus, changes in gut microbiota affect not only the
        composition of bile acids but also the bile acid receptor signaling pathway, which in turn play a key role in
        regulating lipid metabolism.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>4.2</h3> Short-chain fatty acids are produced by intestinal bacterial fermentation of non-digestible
        carbohydrates (such as dietary fiber), mainly acetic acid, propionate and butyric acid. After being absorbed by
        the intestinal tract, they enter the blood circulation, affecting the metabolism of liver, adipose tissue,
        skeletal muscle and other peripheral tissues, participating in the regulation of energy, glucose and
        physiological processes, and related to obesity and related metabolic disorders. The intestinal flora regulates
        lipid metabolism by affecting the level of short-chain fatty acids produced by metabolism.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>4.3 </h3> The intestinal flora regulates lipid metabolism by affecting the hormone secretion of
        enteroendocrine cells (such as L cells). These hormones, such as GLP-1 and GLP-2, play important roles in the
        intestinal lipid metabolism, and their secretion is regulated by the intestinal microbiota and their
        metabolites.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>4.4 </h3> The gut microbiota influences the lipid metabolism by regulating the intestinal barrier function.
        The intestinal barrier is made up of a variety of cells that can normally prevent harmful substances such as
        lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from entering the bloodstream. But when the barrier function is impaired, LPS may
        enter the blood and affect health.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>4.5 </h3> The intestinal flora can also play a role in regulating lipid metabolism by producing other
        metabolites. For example, phenylacetic acid is a compound produced by intestinal bacteria breaking down amino
        acids in food, and the increased level of phenylacetic acid in the blood is closely related to the accumulation
        of fat in the liver.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>On the basis of the above literature, we learned from relevant experts that Insig is a key protein in regulating
      lipid metabolism, which can bind with the key cholesterol generating protein, SREBP2, to retain it on the
      endoplasmic reticulum, thus regulating intracellular lipid synthesis. However, the LBK 1 / AMPK axis is able to
      initiate the Insig upstream signaling pathway, which thus upregulates Insig expression. Butyrate, a short-chain
      fatty acid secreted by the gut microbiota, targets LBK 1 and phosphorylates AMP-dependent protein kinases to
      enhance Insig expression. Glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) is a hormone secreted by intestinal L cells that promotes
      insulin secretion in the whole body and regulates systemic glucose and lipid metabolism in a glucose
      concentration-dependent manner. Recent studies suggest that GLP-1 has the potential to act on the LBK 1 / AMPK
      axis and regulate intracellular adipogenesis.</p>
    <p>Based on the literature and the advice of relevant experts, we designed a gut-engineered bacterial product. This
      product regulates intestinal lipid metabolism by enhancing butyrate synthesis and autocrine GLP-1, thereby by dual
      targeting of the LBK 1 / AMPK / Insig axis.</p>
    <p>This product helps to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and improve the quality of life of the patients.
      For people with diabetes and hypercholesterolemia, this product can not only relieve the disease, but also reduce
      dietary restrictions, increase the enthusiasm for treatment and promote mental health. For non-diabetic or
      hypercholesterolemia patients, the product is equally protective against obesity or health promotion.</p>

    <h2>5. Market decision: hand in hand, create a better future</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>By understanding the current industry prospects, we have found that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>5.1</h3>
        At present, the market of diabetes diagnosis and treatment is large but still relatively blank. The awareness
        rate and treatment rate of diabetes patients are relatively low, and many patients need to pay more attention to
        the disease.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3> 5.2 </h3>
        No other drug is perfect in the diabetes market today, All more or less have their own shortcomings (for
        example, In the oral hypoglycemic agents, The advantages of metformingood hypoglycemic effect and weight loss
        and cardiovascular protection, However, metformin often causes gastrointestinal reactions, The risk of lactic
        acidosis; Sulphonylurea agents are effective and cheap, But it is often accompanied by hypoglycemia response,
        weight gain and secondary failure; High bioavailability of Glinide-like proagents, Short duration of action, But
        there is hypoglycemia, digestive tract reaction, abnormal liver function; ɑ -glycocoase inhibitors are effective
        in reducing postprandial blood glucose and are suitable for Asian early diabetic patients, However, ɑ
        -glycoglycoase inhibitors were dominated by control, Have a certain gastrointestinal tract reaction; GLP-1
        receptor agonists protect islet β cells, hypoglycemic and suitable for combination or combination, But the price
        is more expensive, Mainly by injection, Long-term use such as liraglutide may lead to decreased efficacy and
        impaired β -cell function; DPP-4 inhibitors protect islet β cells, hypoglycemic and suitable for combination or
        combination, But the efficacy of prolonged use is uncertain, FDA continuous warning of DPP-4 joint risk and the
        combination of heart failure risk; SGLT-2 inhibitors use all stages of diabetes, effectively reduce HbA 1 c,
        reduce weight and reduce blood pressure, But expensive and no cardiovascular evaluation does not impress the
        FDA, FDA continuous warning of high risk of severe ketoacidosis and urinary tract infection).
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>5.3</h3>
        There are many problems to be solved in the hierarchical diagnosis and treatment of chronic disease
        management.(The complicated treatment of diabetes makes it more difficult to self-manage patients; the basic
        medical information exchange is not smooth, and the diagnosis and treatment level is uneven;)
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>5.4</h3>
        Diet control is difficult, and for many patients, strict diet control and maintaining healthy eating habits are
        a challenge. Traditional dietary control methods lack personalization and precision to meet the needs of
        different patients.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>According to the above market research, it is urgent to study a new economical drug that can better meet the
      needs of patients. Our product focuses on the dual targeting technology of engineering bacteria, and accurately
      acts on the LBK 1 / AMPK / Insig axis to regulate intestinal lipid metabolism in an innovative way. By enhancing
      Insig expression and self-secrete GLP-1, the project achieved a significant reduction in cholesterol level,
      significant efficacy and frontier method, far beyond the limitations of traditional cholesterol-lowering drugs,
      not only has high safety, but also immune regulation effect, showing a high degree of innovation and foresight. In
      addition, the research direction of this project is broad, not only for the treatment of high cholesterol, but
      also with the potential to expand the treatment of a variety of metabolic diseases, with a large target group and
      strong market demand, providing valuable new treatment perspectives and strategies, indicating broad application
      prospects and far-reaching social value.
      After fully demonstrated the feasibility and market prospects of the project, we contacted the biopharmaceutical
      company and submitted a detailed project plan. The senior management of the company spoke highly of the project,
      and decided to fully support the research and development and marketing of the project. Subsequently, the company
      quickly set up a cross-department RESEARCH and development team, integrating research and development, marketing,
      sales and other resources, providing a solid guarantee for the smooth implementation of the project.

    <h2>6. Product introduction: keep improving, the pursuit of excellence</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>This product mainly transforms the plasmids expressing the target gene GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide) and BCoAT
      (butyyl / hexyl-CoA) into E. coli and selects the intestinal engineering bacteria expressing only BCoAT and double
      expressing BCoAT and GLP-1, When performing the high-fat and high-sugar diets, The initiation of the upstream
      Insig signaling pathway and GLP-1 gene expression via the LBK 1 / AMPK axis to promote insulin secretion,
      respectively, Enable the engineered bacteria to function to reduce lipid and sugar synthesis, It lays the
      foundation for the wide application of regulating cholesterol and sugar levels through intestinal microbes. Among
      them, the gene in engineered bacteria, BCoAT, participates in the synthesis and secretion of butyric acid by
      encoding butyyl / hexanyl-enzyme A, a key protein in the metabolism of short-chain fatty acid. Burate, as a
      short-chain fatty acid secreted by intestinal microbiota, can target LBK 1 and phosphorylate AMP dependent protein
      kinase to enhance the expression of Insig, so that the protein Insig binds the key cholesterol ogenic protein
      SREBP2 to bind it on the endoplasmic reticulum and regulate intracellular lipid synthesis.</p>
    <p>This product uses genetic engineering technology to accurately transform plasmids containing the target gene
      GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide) and BCoAT (butyyl / hexyl CoA) into Escherichia coli and achieve stable expression.
      After the screening process, intestinal engineered bacteria expressing only BCoAT and both BCoAT and GLP-1 were
      developed.</p>
    <p>These gut-engineered bacteria play a vital role in consuming high-fat and sugary foods. By activating the Insig
      upstream signaling pathway, they activate the LBK 1 / AMPK axis, and promote the expression of the GLP-1 gene,
      which then stimulate insulin secretion. This complex series of biochemical reactions is designed to effectively
      reduce the synthesis of lipids and sugars, thus maintaining the metabolic balance in the human body.</p>
    <p>The BCoAT gene in engineered bacteria encodes a key short-chain fatty acid metabolic protein, —— butyyl /
      hexanyl-CoA. This protein plays a central role in the synthesis and secretion of butyric acid. Butyrate, a gut
      bioactive SCFA with unique bioactivity, accurately targets LBK 1 and enhances Insig expression by phosphorylating
      AMP-dependent protein kinases. With enhanced Insig expression, it is able to bind to SREBP2, a key protein for
      cholesterol production, thereby retaining it on the endoplasmic reticulum. This process effectively regulates the
      intracellular lipid synthesis, allowing the body to maintain a healthier metabolic state in the face of a high-fat
      and high-glucose diet.</p>
    <img class="rounded mx-auto d-block" src="static/entrepreneurship/image4.webp"
      alt="chart-1">
    <p>In the development process, we encountered many challenges, such as technical bottlenecks, cost control, user
      experience optimization and so on. However, the team members always maintain a high sense of responsibility and
      mission, constantly overcome difficulties and optimize product performance. After several months of hard work, we
      finally successfully developed the SugarGuardian, and successfully passed the strict quality testing and safety
      assessments.</p>
    <p>Introduction to the experimental operation process: First, the transgenic technology is used to build an
      engineered probiotics, which will contain the key genes of ISMA, BCoAT and BSH. After the construction, a series
      of in vitro validation experiments were performed to accurately determine the expression of these target genes. In
      this process, an exhaustive statistical analysis was performed by changing the pH, temperature, and nutrient
      content to assess the overall robustness of the strains. In addition, we will culture the strains with BCM and GMM
      media and test their metabolites to verify the ability of the strains to degrade cholesterol by statistical
      analysis. This step is essential for determining the strain efficacy. Subsequently, we will introduce mRFP markers
      and use an oleic acid inducer to distinguish the reporter strain from the acting strain. For these two classes of
      strains, we will perform in vitro validation and obtain precise results by in vitro analysis. This series of
      experimental designs is designed to ensure that we can conduct a comprehensive and in-depth evaluation of the
      performance of the engineered probiotics, providing a solid foundation for subsequent applied research.</p>

      <h3>Introduction of the product components:</h3>
      <hr>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h4>ELIASA</h4>
          <p>Microplate reader, also known as enzyme-linked immunodetector, is a special instrument for enzyme-linked
            immunosorbent test, also known as microplate detector. Its core lies in the method of colorimetry, and the
            principle of photoelectric colorimetry is quite similar. The light wave emitted by the light lamp is
            converted by a filter or monochroor into a monochrome beam, and then projected on the sample to be tested in
            the plastic microplate. The monochromatic light is absorbed by the sample, and the rest is reflected through
            the sample, reflected on the photoelectric detector. The photoelectric detector converts the other optical
            signal due to the sample difference into the corresponding electrical signal. This electrical signal is
            transmitted by a series of signal processing to the microprocessor for data processing and calculation, and
            the results are presented by the display and printer.</p>
          <p>The microplate reader can be divided into semi-automatic and fully automatic two categories. In view of the
            measurement requirements, the final volume of the test solution must be controlled below 250 μ L. Microplate
            reader is widely used in the medical field, such as detecting the concentration of bacterial solution and
            measuring the content of polysaccharide in edible fungi. In this experiment, the reporter was detected by a
            microplate reader to observe its effect.</p>

        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Of the SDS-Page electrophoresis</h4>
          <p>For the SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, the protein sample will be mixed with the SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate).
            SDS is an anionic surfactant able to interrupt hydrogen and hydrophobic bonds of proteins, denature the
            protein and associate with them to form short rod-like complexes of the same density. The mobility of this
            complex upon electrophoresis is no longer affected by the original charge and molecular shape, but only by
            molecular weight. Therefore, SDS-PAGE electrophoresis can separate the proteins into several regional bands
            depending on their molecular weight. Page allows denatured proteins of different sizes to move in them at
            different rates, and the two work together to separate proteins. In this experiment, the expression was
            detected by SDS-Page electrophoresis on the extracted protein products.</p>

        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>BCM, GMM, MRS, and M9 media</h4>
          <p>BCM medium, the conditioned reprogramming medium for primary mammary epithelial cells (Human Mammary
            Epithelial Cell Conditional Reprogramming Medium). The medium is a sterile liquid mixing system containing
            various components including essential and nonessential amino acids, vitamins, organic and inorganic
            compounds, hormones, growth factors, and trace minerals. The formulation of this medium is intended to
            provide various nutrients and growth factors required for primary mammary cells to grow in an in vitro
            environment, thus supporting the normal metabolism and proliferation of cells. BCM medium has the
            characteristics of promoting cell growth and proliferation and maintaining cell characteristics. Moreover,
            the low stress properties of BCM medium helps to reduce cell damage and death during culture. This medium is
            able to reduce the sensitivity of cells to environmental changes and improve cell survival and stability,
            thereby increasing the reliability and reproducibility of the experiments.</p>
          <p>GMM medium is a formulation-specific medium that contains glucose, Nitrate Salts, as well as other
            essential nutritional components. The medium was subjected to precise pH regulation and agar powder as
            coagulant. GMM medium was used as a medium for gut microbes for in vitro culture and study of gut
            microbiota. By adjusting the composition of the medium (e. g., oligomeric isomaltose, arabinogalactan, and
            pectin), the environment in the gut can be simulated to support the growth and metabolism of the gut
            microbes.</p>
          <p>MRS medium, the full name De Man, Rogosa and Sharpe medium, is a medium commonly used for selective
            isolation and counting of lactobacilli. The formulation of MRS medium can support the growth of
            Lactobacillus. It usually contains nutrients such as beef paste, protein, yeast paste, as well as specific
            carbon and nitrogen sources to provide the energy and construction needed for lactic acid bacteria. In
            addition, MRS medium was supplemented with certain selective inhibitors such as lithium acetate and crystal
            violet to inhibit the growth of non-lactobacillus, enabling selective isolation of lactobacillus.</p>
          <p>M9 medium is a synthetic medium fully quantified and defined. It is a commonly used E.coli medium for
            molecular biology and protein structure studies and is particularly suitable for all wild-type E. coli

          </ul>
          <p>After taking probiotics, the internal engineered bacteria show multiple cholesterol-lowering effects
            through specific genetic mechanisms. First, the hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD) encoded by ISMA plays a
            key role in the conversion of cholesterol into fecal sterol that cannot be absorbed by the human body,
            especially at the beginning and end of this transformation process. In addition, gene BSH promotes the
            conversion and excretion of bile acids through two mechanisms. On the one hand, it drives the transition of
            conjugated bile acids to nonconjugated bile acids, which makes it more difficult to form bile salts and
            lipid complexes, thereby increasing their hydrophobicity and reducing solubility, which in turn promotes the
            flow of non-conjugated bile acids to the intestine. </p>
          <p>On the other hand, BSH also promotes the conversion of bound bile acids to free bile acids, allowing free
            bile acids to combine with cholesterol to form a precipitate, which is then excreted in the feces. Together,
            these two mechanisms significantly reduce the bile acid circulating pool in the intestine, thus promoting
            the conversion of cholesterol to bile acids, and thus achieving lower cholesterol levels.</p>
          <p>Moreover, the gene BCOAT regulates the gut flora by producing butyrate, which further reduced cholesterol
            levels. This series of biological processes not only prevents the occurrence of hypercholesterolemia at the
            source, and then reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease, but also improves the quality of life of
            hypercholesterolemic patients. While receiving treatment, patients can reduce dietary restrictions, improve
            the enthusiasm for treatment, and promote mood pleasure. For non-hypercholesterolemic patients, probiotics
            intake is also effective in preventing obesity and promoting overall health.</p>

          <h4>Analysis of product technical advantages:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h5>Foreign research</h5>
              <p>There is growing scientific evidence that intestinal bacteria play an important role in preventing
                obesity and other chronic diseases, leading British media reported. Now, new research has found that
                intestinal probiotics can help reduce the risk of some cancers.</p>
              <p>Researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles (University of California, Los Angeles) have
                studied Lactobacillus acidophilus (Lactobacillus johnsonii 456), a species of abundant probiotics and
                commonly used to make fermented foods such as Youg. The results found that L. acidophilus can reduce
                genetic damage and significantly reduce inflammation in the body, which affects many diseases, including
                aging, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases (including dementia, Parkinsons disease), heart disease,
                arthritis, and more. The intestinal probiotics are sufficient to help delay the occurrence of cancer, so
                moderate supplementation of probiotics can help prevent cancer. Uge is rich in probiotics, moderate
                supplementation can help improve immunity and prevent cancer. Cluster can affect lymphatic probiotics
                supplementation to reduce inflammation, and past studies by the same authors showed an association
                between the intestinal cluster and the development of lymphatic cancer, which comes from the immune
                system.</p>
              <p>The gut microbiota may play a role in the development of hypercholesterolaemia. Hypercholesterolemic
                patients had significantly higher serum levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL cholesterol
                than in healthy individuals, but the richness and diversity of the intestinal flora were significantly
                reduced. A European study in normal populations, those with impaired glycemic control or diabetic
                population found that serum triglyceride levels were negatively associated with Clostridium bacteria,
                while HDL was positively associated with Clostridium bacteria.</p>
              <p>Professor Cani found that after 2 to 4 weeks of high-fat diet feeding, mice developed an obese
                phenotype, reduced bifidobacteria in the gut, and increased blood lipopolysaccharide levels 2-3 times
                but significantly lower than the endotoxin levels in septic shock. Therefore, it is called "metabolic
                endotoxemia". This long-term low-level elevation of LPS is sufficient to increase the expression of
                inflammatory factors in the liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue, triggering insulin
                resistance."Metabolism endotoxemia" hypothesis explains the high fat diet causes chronic low
                inflammation mechanism: diet induced intestinal flora change, increase the number of opportunistic
                pathogens, reduce the number of protective intestinal barrier bacteria, affect intestinal epithelial
                cell gene expression, lead to intestinal permeability increase, make into the blood endotoxin, cause
                chronic inflammatory reaction, and produce obesity, insulin resistance and metabolic disorders.</p>



              <p>Probiotics are microorganisms that originate from the host and promote the host health.
                Cholesterol-lowering function is one of the main probiotic functions of some probiotics. In recent
                years, the international progress of in vitro and in vivo research on probiotics, mainly includes the
                relationship between bacterial growth and cholesterol lowering, the influence of pH, the role of
                cholate, cholate hydrolase activity, the use of prebiotics, human and animal feeding experiments and
                other aspects. At present, the mechanism of cholesterol lowering of probiotics mainly include
                co-precipitation, the decomposition of enzymes on cholate, the incorporation of cholesterol into cell
                membrane, and the absorption of cholesterol by bacteria, etc. These mechanism hypotheses need to be
                further studied and confirmed. The research and development prospect of cholesterol-lowering probiotics
                products is very broad.</p>
              <p>Healthy gut flora is also protective against metabolic disorders. Transfer of fecal flora from healthy
                individuals to the gut of patients with metabolic syndrome by duodenal catheterization can alter their
                gut flora and improve their insulin sensitivity. Animal studies have shown that certain specific
                bacterial species are beneficial for ameliorating metabolic disorders, for example, mucophilin Akmania
                improves diet-induced obesity, fasting blood glucose and adipose tissue metabolism.</p>

              <h5>Domestic research</h5>
              <p>Hypercholesterolemia is a metabolic disease characterized by the amount of cholesterol beyond the
                normal range, which usually originates from abnormalities in lipid metabolism and is closely related to
                the occurrence of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Although drug therapy is the main means
                of dealing with hypercholesterolemia, its side effects such as damage to the liver and kidney function
                cannot be ignored. Therefore, it is particularly important to find alternative therapies.</p>
              <p>As a class of microorganisms beneficial to human health, probiotics have received much attention in the
                regulation of lipid metabolism. Several studies have shown a close association between probiotics and
                lipid metabolism, so the use of probiotics to alleviate hypercholesterolemia is of potential importance.
                At present, in vitro screening of probiotics with the effect of alleviating hypercholesterolemia mainly
                through two indicators: one is the dissociation characteristics of bile salt, the other is the
                cholesterol absorption characteristics. However, the current study did not systematically compare the
                effects of probiotics and the mechanism of different cholesterolysis capacity and cholesterol adsorption
                capacity to alleviate hypercholesterolemia. Therefore, some domestic studies took probiotics with
                different bile salt dissociation ability and cholesterol absorption ability as research objects to
                explore the role and potential mechanism of probiotics on hypercholesterolemia. The main results are as
                follows: First, selective media MRS and LAWAB were used to isolate probiotics, and a total of 54 strains
                of probiotics were identified. Using bile salt dissociation ability and cholesterol absorption ability
                as in vitro screening indicators of probiotics to alleviate hypercholesterolemia, 14 probiotics in 4
                groups with different abilities were obtained. Capacity group 1 were probiotics: bifidobacterium longum
                (Bifidobacterium longum CCFM 1077, I5, I7), Lactobacillus reuteri (Lactobacillus reuteri A9),
                Lactobacillus mucosa (Lactobacillus mucosae A13); Capacity Group 2 was bifidobacterium longum
                (Bifidobacterium longum I3, J2, J5) with only high bile salt dissociation ability; Capacity group 3
                bifidobacterium with high cholesterol absorption capacity (Bifidobacterium longum J3, I1, J8); Capacity
                Group 4 is not both probiotics (Bifidobacterium longum B3, B8, B10). The 14 probiotics were tested to
                tolerate gastric acid and high bile salt, and showed that all 14 probiotics could tolerate the simulated
                gastrointestinal environment. Finally, the growth characteristics of the above 14 probiotics were
                determined, which showed that these strains could plateau within 24h. These results proved that these 14
                probiotics with different bile salt dissociation and cholesterol absorption capacity could have the
                potential for in-depth animal testing and population efficacy evaluation. Secondly, the inquiry has
                different courageRelief effect of Bifidobacterium longum with salt dissociation capacity and cholesterol
                absorption capacity on hypercholesterolaemia in rats at different doses. The results indicated that when
                the number of ingested probiotics was at 1108 CFU / d, Only bifidobacterium longum (Bifidobacterium
                longum CCFM 1077, I5, I7) with the above two abilities could significantly reduce serum cholesterol (p
                &lt;0.0001) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol content (p &lt;0.0001); When the amount of
                probiotics ingested was increased by two orders of magnitude (11010 CFU / day), Bifidobacterium longum,
                with only one of the above abilities, significantly reduced serum cholesterol (p &lt;0.0001), LDL
                cholesterol content (p &lt;0.0001); and whether the amount consumed was low or high dose, No
                bifidobacterium can alleviate hypercholesterolemia. For further verification, Lactobacillus reuteri
                (Lactobacillus reuteri A9), Lactobacillus mucosa (Lactobacillus mucosae A13) and positive control
                strains (Lactobacillus plantarum ST-III) were selected to explore the relieving effect of three
                Lactobacillus strains in hypercholesterolemic rats. The results showed that these two strains
                significantly reduced serum cholesterol and LDL cholesterol at low doses. The above results suggest that
                probiotics with different bile salt dissociation and cholesterol absorption capacity also do not
                alleviate cholesterolaemia</p>
              <p>Based on the above results, further explore the potential mechanism of probiotics to alleviate
                hypercholesterolemia: (1) using ultra-efficient liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometer to
                simulate the probiotics of bile acid composition, found with high bile salt dissociation ability
                probiotics will combine bile acid dissociation into free bile acid to change the bile acid metabolism,
                especially significantly reduce the amount of glycine-bound bile acid content, and then change
                cholesterol metabolism.(2) Through metagenomics analysis of the role of probiotics on intestinal
                microorganisms, it is found that probiotics with high bile salt dissociation ability and high
                cholesterol absorption capacity can significantly improve the diversity of intestinal microbes and
                increase the relative abundance of beneficial bacterial genera.(3) Explore the role of probiotics on
                genes closely related to cholesterol metabolism through molecular biology techniques. The results showed
                that probiotics with the above two abilities could regulate cholesterol metabolism in vivo by
                upregulating the expression of CYP7A1, LXR, SREBP2 and LDLR and downregulating the expression of FXR and
                SHP. This study further evaluated the clinical efficacy of Bifidobacterium longum CCFM1077 in patients
                with hypercholesterolaemia. The results showed that bifidobacterium longum CCFM1077 alleviated
                hypercholesterolemia by reducing the content of serum cholesterol and LDL cholesterol. The metagenomic
                analysis results found that bifidobacterium CCFM1077 enriched the diversity of intestinal microbes of
                patients with hypercholesterolemia, and changed the composition of intestinal microorganisms, improved
                the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes and Fusobacterium, and reduced the relative abundance of
                Muribaculaceae and Parasutterell, butyrococcus with short-chain fatty acids, Lactobacillus producing
                polysaccharide, high mucin and cholesterol metabolism, and then changed the intestinal microenvironment
                of patients with hypercholesterolaemia. In addition, the results of the untargeted metabolome showed
                that bifidobacterium longum CCFM1077 can also alleviate hypercholesterolemia by affecting bile acid
                biosynthesis, ammonia cycle, and propionate metabolism, especially by increasing the excretion of bile
                acids in the feces of hypercholesterolemia patients.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h5>product superiority</h5>
              <p>At present, in clinical practice, in order to achieve accurate control of cholesterol levels, doctors
                generally recommend patients to use statins and fibrates. The core mechanism of action of statins is its
                hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-COA) reductase inhibitor, which plays a crucial role in the human
                body. By competitive inhibition of the key enzyme in the synthesis of cholesterol, statins are able to
                effectively reduce the amount of cholesterol synthesized. However, despite these drugs excellent
                performance in lowering cholesterol, the potential side effects cannot be ignored when used at high
                doses.</p>
              <p>Most notably, statins may increase the risk of rhabdomyolysis, myositis, anaphylaxis and other on. In
                addition, it may also cause cognitive impairment during the drug period, as well as gastrointestinal
                reactions, such as nausea and vomiting. More seriously, male patients may also suffer from reduced
                sexual function after using statins.</p>
              <p>More complex, drug-drug interactions can also lead to serious consequences. For example, when statins
                are combined with azithromycin, azithromycin can inhibit the enzyme ——CYP3A4 in the liver, which
                significantly reduces the metabolism rate of statins in the body, which leads to the accumulation of
                drugs in the body, produces toxic effects, and may even induce serious complications such as liver
                failure.</p>
              <p>In addition to drug-drug interactions, certain foods in the daily diet may also influence statin
                metabolism. In particular, fruits such as grapefruit and oranges, especially grapefruit on red soil,
                have a significant effect on the metabolism of statins. Therefore, during taking statins, patients need
                to pay special attention to dietary adjustments to avoid adverse interactions between food and drugs.
                However, cholesterol-lowering products demonstrate unique advantages over conventional
                cholesterol-lowering drugs. These products are not only efficient and safe, but also have no side
                effects, so they receive more and more peoples attention and favor. By regulating the probiotics in the
                intestine, they form a competitive advantage with other harmful bacteria and inhibit their growth, so as
                to maintain the normal metabolism of cholesterol and other substances and protect the balance of the
                intestinal microecosystem.
              </p>
              <p>In addition, the regulation of probiotics also helps to improve the bodys immunity. The structure of
                probiotics, such as peptidoglycan, lipoteichoic acid and other components, can directly act as antigens,
                or through autocrine immune activators, stimulate the host immune system, and then enhance immunity.
                This immunomodulatory effect helps to enhance the resistance to the disease and improve the quality of
                life.</p>
              <p>Therefore, the cholesterol-lowering products regulated by probiotics can not only effectively reduce
                cholesterol levels, but also avoid the possible side effects of traditional drugs, and improve the bodys
                immunity. Therefore, this method has promising applications and important clinical value in
                cholesterol-lowering therapy.</p>

    <h2>11. Pricing strategy: everything is based on cost</h2>
    <hr>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>11.1 Use dynamic pricing to reasonably set product prices</h3>
        <p>In todays fierce competition in the medical market, companies need to price their products flexibly and
          wisely to ensure that they can meet patient needs while maintaining corporate profitability. Dynamic pricing
          strategy is an effective way to adapt to the market changes. The core of this strategy is the real-time
          adjustment of prices in response to various variables of the market, including customer characteristics,
          geographical differences, purchase timing, market supply and demand conditions, and the actions of
          competitors. Companies need to deeply study the target market to understand the needs and affordability of
          different customer groups, as well as the impact of geographical characteristics on price sensitivity. By
          collecting data on market supply and demand, seasonal fluctuations, and customer purchasing behavior, and
          using statistical and machine learning techniques, we develop mathematical models to predict the optimal price
          in different situations. Implement a real-time monitoring system to track sales data, customer feedback and
          competitor pricing changes, and flexibly adjust prices according to model forecast and market feedback to
          maximize profit and market share. Dynamic pricing strategy can quickly respond to market changes and improve
          the market adaptability and competitiveness of enterprises. However, this also requires enterprises to have
          strong data analysis capabilities and rapid decision-making mechanism. As the healthcare industry evolves and
          the market environment changes, companies need to continuously optimize and adjust their pricing strategies to
          achieve long-term success and growth.

        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>11.2 Pricing of diabetes drugs based on the cost</h3>
        <p>For newly developed diabetes therapy drugs, a cost-based pricing strategy is an effective way to ensure
          corporate profitability and market competitiveness. First, companies need to accurately calculate all the
          costs per unit of drug, including raw materials, production processes, quality control, research and
          development, equipment depreciation, employee wages, and sales and marketing costs. Then, make a deep study of
          the prices of similar products in the market, determine the price range, and set the price of the products at
          about 80% of the price of the competitors, in order to attract consumers. This strategy aims to attract
          consumers at more competitive prices, while ensuring that companies can make reasonable profits and support
          their long-term development and innovation. </p>
        <p>The cost-based pricing strategy is straightforward and easy to understand and implement. However, it may
          ignore the dynamics of the market and the perceived value of the customers. Therefore, enterprises need to
          consider the competitive environment after the expiration of drug patents, and develop long-term price
          adjustment strategies to adapt to the changes in the market. At the same time, ensure that the pricing
          strategy complies with local laws and healthcare-related regulations, and regularly evaluate and adjust the
          pricing strategy based on market feedback and sales data. This integrated approach ensures the flexibility of
          enterprises in responding to market changes, but also guarantees the cost-based robustness, which provides a
          solid foundation for the sustainable development of enterprises in the medical market.</p>

    <p>Porter five-force analysis model was proposed by Michael Porter (Michael Porter) in the early 1980s for the
      analysis of competitive strategy, which can effectively analyze the competitive environment of customers.</p>
    <p>There are five basic competitive forces in the competition in the industry. The situation and comprehensive
      strength of these five basic competitive forces determine the intensity of competition in the industry, thus
      determining the final profit potential of the industry and the degree of capital flow to the industry, and all
      these ultimately determine the ability of enterprises to maintain high returns. The five forces are: the
      bargaining power of suppliers, the bargaining power of buyers, the ability of potential competitors to enter, the
      substitution ability of substitutes, and the current competitive ability of competitors in the industry. The
      change of different combinations of the five forces ultimately affects the change of the profit potential of the
      industry and determines the profitability of the industry, and points out that the core of the enterprise strategy
      should lie in the selection of the right industry and the most attractive competitive position in the industry.

    <p>The life cycle of this diabetes treatment drug can be divided into the following stages:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>(1) Exploratory period: The main feature of this stage is that it has just been introduced into the market,
        the research and development and production of products are still relatively preliminary, and the market
        response is not obvious. At this time, a lot of research and development work needs to be carried out to
        determine the characteristics and advantages of the product to attract the attention of consumers.</li>
      <li>(2) Growth period: With the gradual entry of products into the market, consumers demand for artificial skin
        begins to increase, and the sales of products gradually increase. At this stage, enterprises need to gradually
        expand the production scale, strengthen the brand publicity, improve the quality and performance of products, to
        meet the market demand.</li>
      <li>(3) Maturity period: At this stage, there are already many competitors in the market, and the market
        competition is becoming increasingly fierce, and the sales growth rate of products is gradually slowing down. At
        this point, enterprises need to maintain their existing market share, and develop new markets and products, and
        constantly improve the quality and added value of products.</li>
      <li>(4) Decession period: After the maturity period, if the enterprise does not update the product and adjust its
        strategy in time, the market competitiveness of the product will gradually decline, and the sales will begin to
        decline. At this point, enterprises need to re-examine their products and market strategies, and take measures
        to adjust their strategies to avoid being eliminated. If the adjustment is not timely or improper, the product
        may eventually go to the decline period, until it is eliminated.</li>

        <h3>Focus on after-sales service level</h3>
        <p>After-sales service is an important part of customer relationship management, and also one of the key links
          to maintain value customers and explore potential customers. However, because it does not directly generate
          profits, it is always ignored. Effective and reliable after-sales service quality can not only enable the
          company to obtain low risk benefits for a long time, but also easier to obtain the favor of consumers. Our
          company has a special after-sales service department, through the professional customer service personnel
          telephone, door-to-door and other services, to solve problems for customer groups, so that consumers can use
          the products safely and safely. It can better optimize the user experience of consumers in the process of
          product use, and improve the purchase intention of consumers.</p>

          to the development of The Times. Experience marketing adhere to the traditional marketing mode, experience
          marketing is a new marketing means to cater to the development of The Times. Experience marketing adhere to

          core.</p>

      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Suppliers bargaining power </h3>
        <p>When analyzing the bargaining power of suppliers, we need to comprehensively consider the raw material
          supply, technical cooperation, and engineering bacteria customized production and other aspects. This project
          focuses on developing an innovative therapy capable of dual targeting of the LBK 1 / AMPK / Insig axis to
          improve health through modulation of intestinal lipid metabolism. This therapy relies on the engineering of
          specific strains that efficiently synthesize butyrate and self-secrete glucagon-like peptides (GLP-1).</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h4>(1). Bargaining power of raw material suppliers</h4>
            <p>The core raw materials of this project mainly include various types of media components for engineered
              bacteria culture, precursor substances of short-chain fatty acids (e. g., butyric acid), and
              biotechnological reagents for gene editing and bacterial modification.</p>
            <p>Media component supplier: Media is the basis of bacterial growth and reproduction, and its components
              include carbon sources, nitrogen sources, inorganic salts, growth factors, etc. Because these basic raw
              materials are widely available in the market, with many suppliers and fierce market competition, the
              bargaining power of such suppliers is relatively weak. The project team can effectively reduce the
              procurement cost through multiple price comparison, centralized procurement and other methods.</p>
            <p>Biotechnology reagent supplier: For the high-precision biotechnology reagents required for gene editing
              and bacterial modification, such as CRISPR-Cas 9 system components, plasmid vectors, restriction enzymes,
              etc., the market is relatively concentrated and has a high technical content. These reagents are usually
              produced by a few internationally well-known enterprises, with certain technical barriers and patent
              protection. Therefore, such suppliers have strong bargaining power. The project team needs to establish a
              stable cooperative relationship, strive for long-term cooperation concessions, and explore domestic
              alternatives to reduce the dependence on a single supplier.</p>

          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>(2). Bargaining power of engineering bacteria customized production service providers</h4>
            <p>The core of this project lies in the customized development of engineered bacteria, including strain
              screening, gene editing, functional verification and other links. These jobs often require customized
              services provided by specialized biotechnology companies.</p>
            <p>Technical threshold and professionalism: The customized development of engineering bacteria belongs to a
              highly specialized service field, with high requirements on technical strength and experimental
              conditions. The number of companies that can provide such services is limited, and each company has its
              own unique technological advantage and patent portfolio. Therefore, this kind of service provider has a
              strong bargaining power. When selecting partners, the project team should give full consideration to its
              technical strength, past project experience, service quality and other factors, and strive to clarify the
              ownership of technical achievements, service standards, confidentiality agreement and other terms in the
              contract, so as to safeguard its own rights and interests.</p>
            <p>Degree of customization and demand specificity: As the engineering bacteria in this project need to have
              the function of enhancing butyrate synthesis and self-secreting GLP-1, this demand is rare in the market
              and requires a high degree of customization. Therefore, the service provider may take advantage of its
              technical advantages and information asymmetry to increase the quotation in the negotiation process. The
              project team should conduct sufficient market research and demand analysis in advance, and clarify the
              specific performance indicators and acceptance criteria of the engineering bacteria, so as to occupy a
              favorable position in the negotiation.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>(3) . Negotiation capacity for producing short-chain fatty acids and GLP-1 analogues</h4>
            <p>Although this project is dedicated to the direct synthesis of butyrate and secretion of GLP-1 by
              engineered bacteria, exogenous addition of these substances may require functional verification or
              supplementation at the early stages of development or during the production process. Therefore, the
              bargaining power of producers of short-chain fatty acids and GLP-1 analogues also needs to be evaluated.
            </p>
            <p>Market supply and demand conditions: short-chain fatty acids (such as butyric acid) are widely used in
              agriculture, food, medicine and other fields, and the market supply is relatively sufficient. However,
              high purity, specific specification of SCFAs may still dominate the market by a few producers, with some
              bargaining power. For biological products such as GLP-1 analogues, due to the difficult research and
              development and high production cost, the market supply is relatively tight, and the manufacturers have
              higher bargaining power.</p>
            <p>Procurement Strategies and Alternatives: In order to reduce the reliance on specific manufacturers and
              procurement costs, the project team can adopt diversified procurement strategies and establish
              partnerships with multiple manufacturers. At the same time, actively explore alternatives, such as through
              chemical synthesis or biological fermentation, to improve the flexibility and stability of the supply
              chain.</p>

          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Buyers chaser bargaining power</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>(1). Market demand and urgency: In todays society, with the improvement of peoples living standards and
            the enhancement of health awareness, the attention to health management and disease prevention is
            increasing. The incidence of diseases caused by lipid metabolism disorders, such as obesity, diabetes and
            cardiovascular diseases, is increasing year by year, which sharply increases the market demand for products
            that regulate intestinal lipid metabolism. The intestinal lipid metabolism regulation protocol with dual
            targeting of LBK 1 / AMPK / Insig axis proposed in this project aims to improve lipid metabolism, prevent
            and treat related metabolic diseases through innovative biotechnology means, so its market demand is highly
            urgent and realistic. For buyers, such products can not only satisfy their pursuit of a healthy life, but
            also can effectively address the health risks of lipid metabolism disorders. In particular, individuals who
            already have metabolic disease or are in high-risk groups have a more urgent demand for such products. This
            urgent demand makes the buyers often pay more attention to the efficacy and safety of the product when
            facing the product, rather than the simple price factor;</li>
          <li>(2). Product uniqueness and differentiation advantages: The engineered bacteria studied in this project
            have the ability of dual-targeted regulation of intestinal lipid metabolism, which is unique in the current
            market. By enhancing butyrate synthesis and self-secreted GLP-1, these engineered bacteria are able to act
            directly on the LBK 1 / AMPK / Insig axis to effectively regulate lipid metabolism for the prevention and
            treatment of metabolic diseases. This unique regulation mechanism makes the products of this project have
            significant differentiation advantages, which can meet the unmet needs in the market. The bargaining power
            of buyers in facing such products with unique and differentiated advantages is often limited. Because of the
            lack of direct alternatives in the market, it is difficult for buyers to reduce the purchase cost by
            comparing the cost performance of different products. At the same time, the efficacy and safety of such
            products need to go through strict clinical trials and verification, buyers tend to choose the verified, the
            exact efficacy of products, rather than just pursue the price advantage;</li>
          <li>(3). Professionalism and information asymmetry: Since this project involves complex biotechnology and
            medical knowledge, buyers are often at a disadvantage of information asymmetry when facing such products.
            They may lack sufficient expertise to assess the true value and potential risks of a product and can only
            rely on information such as expert opinion, clinical data and word-of-mouth to make purchasing decisions.
            This information asymmetry makes the buyer in a passive position in the bargaining process, and it is
            difficult to effectively play the bargaining power. To overcome the disadvantage of information asymmetry,
            buyers may seek professional consultation or rely on recommendations from authorities to choose a product.
            However, this dependence further weakens the bargaining power of buyers, as they often need to make
            decisions within a limited range of information and accept market pricing;</li>
          <li>(4). Change in health investment concept: With the popularization of health awareness and peoples pursuit
            of quality of life, more and more people begin to regard health as a long-term investment. They are willing
            to invest more resources and funds to improve their health status and prevent the occurrence of disease.
            This change in health investment concept enables buyers to pay more attention to the long-term benefits and
            overall value of the products of health-related products, rather than the short-term price advantage. For
            the products studied in this project, its unique regulatory mechanism and significant efficacy make it one
            of the important choices for buyers health investment. Buyers are willing to pay higher prices for such
            products for better health protection and long-term benefits. This change in the health investment concept
            further weakens the bargaining power of the buyers, because they focus more on the overall value and
            long-term benefits of the product rather than the simple price factors;</li>
          <li>(5). Market positioning and brand effect: The products of this project have clear market positioning and
            brand effect. It is aimed at high-end consumer groups with specific health needs, which tend to have high
            consumption power and willingness to pay. At the same time, through scientific research and development,
            strict quality control and marketing and other means, the project product can establish a good brand image
            and reputation effect, so as to further consolidate its market position. The combination of market
            positioning and brand effect makes buyers pay more attention to brand awareness and credibility when
            choosing products. They are more inclined to choose those products with good brand image and reputation
            effect, because these products often able to provide better product quality and service guarantee. This
            brand loyalty makes buyers more tolerant and accept market pricing in the face of price factors;</li>
          <li>(6). Policies, regulations and regulatory environment: In the field of biomedicine, policies, regulations
            and regulatory environment have an important impact on product pricing and the bargaining power of buyers.
            With the increasing strength of the national support for the biomedical industry and the strengthening of
            the supervision, more and more policy dividends and market opportunities have emerged. However, these policy
            dividends and market opportunities are often accompanied by strict regulatory requirements and approval
            processes. For the products studied in this project, it needs to go through a strict clinical trial and
            approval process to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the products. These processes not only increase
            the development cost and cycle of products, but also limit the quantity and quality level of competition for
            similar products in the market. In this context, buyers often lack enough bargaining space and ability to
            face such products, because there are fewer alternatives on the market and uneven quality. At the same time,
            policies and regulations also have a certain guiding role in the pricing of biomedical products. The
            government can regulate the market order and protect the rights and interests of consumers by formulating
            price guiding principles and implementing price supervision and punishment measures. To some extent, these
            policy measures limit the pricing autonomy of manufacturers and improve the bargaining power of buyers.
            However, in practice, the bargaining power of buyers is still relatively weak due to information asymmetry
            and professional restrictions.</li>

    <h2>18. Clear competitors: know yourself and know your enemy</h2>
    <hr>
    <ul>
      <li>18.1 Market attractiveness and blue ocean characteristics: In the current health and nutrition field, with the
        improvement of peoples living standards and increased health awareness, the demand for intestinal health and
        weight management is increasing. The innovative therapy proposed in this project that dual targets the LBK 1 /
        AMPK / Insig axis to regulate intestinal lipid metabolism is in line with this market demand, aiming to help and
        improve lipid metabolism by regulating the intestinal microbiota and its metabolites, so as to control body
        weight and prevent metabolic diseases. This market area is still in the blue ocean stage, with high growth
        potential and profit margins, so it is very attractive to new entrants;</li>
      <li>
        <p>18.2 Technical threshold and challenges: Despite the huge market potential, the technical threshold involved
          in this project is not low. The dual targeting strategy requires engineered bacteria not only the ability to
          efficiently synthesize butyric acid, but also the ability to self-secrete glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1), which
          requires a deep understanding and mastery of multiple disciplines such as microbial genetics, metabolic
          engineering and synthetic biology. New entrants will face huge technical challenges to build engineered
          bacteria in a short period of time.</p>
        <p>Microbial genetic manipulation techniques: To efficiently build and engineer engineered bacteria require
          skilled manipulation of gene editing tools (such as CRISPR-Cas 9 systems) and the ability to accurately
          predict and regulate gene expression levels. New entrants need to invest a lot of resources in technology
          research and development and talent training, in order to gradually establish the corresponding technology
          platform.</p>
        <p>Metabolic engineering optimization: To enhance butyrate synthesis and GLP-1 secretion capacity, fine
          regulation and optimization of metabolic pathways in engineered bacteria are required. This involves multiple
          aspects including a deep understanding of the metabolic network, selection versus overexpression of key
          enzymes, and efficient removal of metabolic byproducts. New entrants need to go through multiple iterations of
          optimization to gradually approach optimal performance.</p>
        <p>Safety and efficacy assessment: Any biological therapy applied to the human body must undergo a rigorous
          safety and efficacy assessment. This includes multiple stages of in vitro experiments, animal experiments, and
          clinical trials. New entrants need to invest a lot of time and money to complete these assessments and ensure
          that the safety and effectiveness of their products meet regulatory requirements.</p>

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>18.3 Market entry costs and risks: In addition to the technical threshold, new entrants also need to consider
          the market entry costs and potential risks.</p>
        <p>R & D investment: To develop competitive products, new entrants need to invest heavily in R & D. This
          includes talent introduction, equipment purchase, reagent and consumables procurement, and clinical trial
          costs. For small and medium-sized enterprises, such investment may be a heavy burden.
          Time cost: from technology research and development to product launch requires multiple stages and long-of
          research and development process. New entrants need to wait patiently for the process of technological
          breakthrough and product maturity, and maintain continuous financial and human input in the process. This time
          cost could be a downside for investors seeking quick returns.
        </p>
        <p>Market risk: Despite the strong market demand, but the market competition pattern is also constantly
          changing. New entrants need to pay close attention to market dynamics and competitors strategy adjustments,
          and develop corresponding market entry strategies to cope with potential market risks. At the same time, the
          changes in policies and regulations may also have an impact on the market access and pricing strategies of
          products.</p>
      </li>

    </ul>
    <h3>The threat of alternatives</h3>
    <p>In the field of intestinal lipid metabolism regulation, despite the innovative and potential clinical application
      of the dual-targeted LBK 1 / AMPK / Insig axis regulation strategy proposed in this project, alert to possible
      alternative threats on the market. These alternatives may come from different technical pathways, drug forms, or
      therapeutic concepts, directly or indirectly competing with this project.</p>
    <h3>Existing drugs and treatment methods:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>(1) Statins: Statins are currently widely used lipid-regulating drugs that reduce the synthesis of cholesterol
        mainly by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase. Although its mechanism of action is different from the dual targeting
        strategy of this project, it has a significant effect in lowering blood lipids and has been widely accepted and
        recognized. The major statin manufacturers in the market include multinational pharmaceutical giants such as
        Pfizer (Lipitor) and AstraZeneca (Crestor), which have high market share and brand influence in the market and
        may constitute direct competition for the project.</li>
      <li>(2) Value drugs: Value drugs are mainly used to reduce triglyceride levels, especially for patients with
        hypertriglyceridemia. Although its main action targets are different from this project, there is an overlap in
        the regulation of lipid metabolism. Major manufacturers, such as GlaxoSmithKline (Fenofibrate), have established
        a stable customer base for their products in the market, which could pose a potential threat to the project.
      </li>
      <li>(3) Intestinal microbial modulators: In recent years, the relationship between intestinal microbes and health
        has attracted more and more attention, and a variety of products have appeared on the market to improve lipid
        metabolism by regulating intestinal microorganisms. These products may include probiotics, prebiotics, or
        synbiotics, which indirectly affect lipid metabolism by improving the intestinal environment. For example,
        DuPont, Nestle and other companies have a layout in this field, and have launched a series of related products.
        Although their direct mechanisms of action are different from those of this project, they may capture market
        share by meeting the consumer demand for the natural, safe regulation of lipid metabolism.</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Research and emerging therapies:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>(1) Gene therapy: With the rapid development of gene editing technology, gene therapy has shown great
        potential in the field of lipid metabolism regulation. Several biotechnology companies are developing gene
        therapies for genes involved in lipid metabolism, aiming to regulate lipid levels by directly modifying gene
        expression. For example, Bluebird Bio, Spark Therapeutics and other companies have actively explored this
        aspect. Although gene therapy is still in development stage and faces many challenges, its potential efficiency
        and precision may make it an important competitor in the future market.</li>
      <li>(2) Cell therapy: Stem cells and other types of cell therapy are increasingly widely used in the field of
        regenerative medicine, some of which also involve the regulation of lipid metabolism. For example, mesenchymal
        stem cells have been used to treat several diseases because of their immune regulation and differentiation
        potential, including diseases associated with abnormal lipid metabolism. Some biotech companies such as
        Mesoblast, Cytori Therapeutics are developing stem cell-based lipid metabolism regulation therapy. These
        therapies may improve lipid metabolism by promoting tissue repair and metabolic reconstruction.</li>
      <li>(3) New small molecule drugs: New small molecule drugs targeting the LBK 1 / AMPK / Insig axis or other
        related signaling pathways are under development. These drugs may regulate lipid metabolism through direct
        inhibition or activation of specific targets, with the advantages of a clear mechanism of action and ease of
        synthesis and purification. Some small biotech companies and innovative drug companies such as Vertex
        Pharmaceuticals and AstraZeneca have some layout in this field. These new small-molecule drugs, once marketed,
        may quickly occupy market share, posing a direct threat to the project.</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>
      Cross-border competition and emerging technologies:
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>(1) Wearable devices and telemedicine: With the development of the Internet of Things and artificial
        intelligence technology, the application of wearable devices and telemedicine services in health management is
        increasingly widespread. Health monitoring devices launched by technology companies such as Fitbit and Apple can
        monitor users physiological indicators in real time, including blood lipid levels. Although these devices
        themselves do not directly modulate lipid metabolism, they indirectly influence the market landscape by
        providing personalized health management and intervention recommendations. Furthermore, telemedicine services
        enable patients with easier access to professional medical advice and treatment options, potentially reducing
        reliance on specific treatment products.</li>
      <li>
        (2) Diet and lifestyle intervention: diet adjustment and lifestyle change are one of the basic measures to
        regulate lipid metabolism. With the improvement of health awareness, more and more people begin to focus on the
        effects of dietary structure and exercise habits on lipid metabolism. A large number of food and health care
        products characterized by low fat, low sugar and high fiber have emerged in the market, as well as App and
        service platforms advocating a healthy lifestyle. Although these non-drug interventions have a relatively slow
        effect and require long-term patient adherence, they have the advantages such as low cost and easy to implement,
        which may have a certain impact on the drug market.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The degree of competition of the competitors in the same industry </h3>
    <p>In the field of intestinal lipid metabolism regulation, with the deepening of scientific research and continuous
      technological progress, more and more enterprises began to enter this market, aiming to improve the health of the
      public through innovative therapies. This strategy of regulating intestinal lipid metabolism by dual-targeting the
      LBK 1 / AMPK / Insig axis, although unique and innovative, still needs to face fierce competition from the same
      industry.</p>
    <ul>

          receptor agonists (such as liraglutide, selmellutide, etc.), the company has been actively exploring new
          metabolic regulation pathways to meet the growing demand for metabolic diseases.</p>
        <p>In the field of intestinal lipid metabolism, Novo Nordisk may compete indirectly by expanding the scope of
          application of its GLP-1 therapy. For example, Novo Nordisk, by developing new drugs that can simultaneously
          promote the secretion and regulation of lipid metabolism, is expected to further enhance its leadership in the
          treatment of metabolic diseases. Therefore, the project needs to pay close attention to Novo Nordisk to
          develop an effective competitive strategy.</p>

      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>2. Eli Lilly (Eli Lilly and Company)</h4>

    <h2>19. Background environment analysis, clear positioning</h2>
    <hr>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>1.Domestic policy environment</h3>
        <p>In recent years, with the in-depth implementation of the national strategy for healthy China and the
          continuous improvement of the national health awareness, the policy support for the management of chronic
          diseases and the prevention and treatment of metabolic diseases has been increasingly strengthened. In the
          field of intestinal lipid metabolism regulation, a series of policy guidance provide a good external
          environment for the R & D and application of this project.</p>
        <p>Incentive policies for pharmaceutical innovation: Since 2015, the state has greatly stimulated the innovation
          vitality of domestic pharmaceutical enterprises through the special project of major new drug innovation, drug
          administration reform, and the opening of the capital market (such as the 18A of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange
          and the Science and Technology Innovation Board). These policies not only lower the threshold for new drug
          research and development, but also accelerate the transformation of innovative achievements, providing
          financial support and market access convenience for the research and development of dual-targeted LBK 1 / AMPK
          / Insig axis to regulate lipid metabolism technology.</p>
        <p>Healthy China strategy: The state clearly puts forward the implementation of the healthy China strategy, and
          puts the peoples health in the strategic position of priority development. This strategy emphasizes prevention
          first, focuses on full life-cycle health management, and encourages the application of scientific and
          technological innovation in health services. In response to this strategy, the dual targeted regulation
          technology of this project aims to improve the national lipid metabolism status and reduce the risk of chronic
          diseases such as cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases.
          Medical insurance cost control and rational drug use policy: In the face of increasing medical expenses, the
          country continues to implement the medical insurance cost control policy, aiming to optimize the allocation of
          medical resources and reduce unnecessary medical expenses. By regulating intestinal lipid metabolism, this
          project is expected to help patients reduce the treatment costs of related diseases caused by dyslipidemia,
          which is in line with the spirit of medical insurance cost control, and also in line with the principle of
          rational drug use, to reduce the side effects of drugs and improve the treatment effect.
        </p>

      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>2. Social and cultural environment</h3>
        <p>With the improvement of living standards and the change of lifestyle, the problem of lipid metabolism
          disorder among Chinese residents is becoming increasingly prominent, and the incidence of metabolic diseases
          such as obesity and hyperlipidemia is increasing year by year. This change has not only affected personal
          health, but also brought great pressure on the social health security system. Therefore, there is an urgent
          need for the products and technologies that can effectively regulate lipid metabolism and prevent metabolic
          diseases.</p>
        <p>Health awareness: modern people pay more attention to health, and more and more people begin to pay attention
          to lifestyle adjustments such as healthy diet and moderate exercise. The emergence of dual targeted regulation
          technology just meets the needs of consumers for health management, and is expected to become a part of a
          healthy lifestyle.</p>
        <p>Popularization of science education: With the development of online media and the increasing popularity of
          health science education, the public has a deeper understanding of the concepts of lipid metabolism and
          intestinal flora. This has laid a good foundation for the marketing and consumer education of the project
          products.</p>

      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>3. Technology competition environment</h3>
        <p>In the field of intestinal lipid metabolism regulation, although many drugs and therapies have been applied
          in the clinic, the dual technology of targeting the LBK 1 / AMPK / Insig axis still has significant innovative
          and differentiated advantages.</p>
        <p>Technological innovation advantages: Through genetic engineering and cell engineering technology, this
          project has developed an engineered bacterium that can enhance the synthesis of butyric acid and
          self-secretion of GLP-1, realizing the dual targeted regulation of intestinal lipid metabolism. This
          innovative technology not only improves the regulation efficiency, but also reduces the side effects of
          traditional drugs, and has a broad market prospect.</p>
        <p>Market competition pattern: Although there are a variety of products regulating lipid metabolism in the
          market, most of them focus on a single target or mechanism. The technical barriers of this project are
          relatively high, and no direct competitive products appear in the market. However, with the maturity of the
          technology and the improvement of the market awareness, it is expected that more enterprises will enter the
          field in the future, and the market competition will gradually intensify.</p>
        <p>Coping strategy: In order to cope with the possible future competition, this project needs to continuously
          increase the investment in R & D, optimize the performance and stability of engineering bacteria, and improve
          the safety and effectiveness of products. At the same time, to strengthen the marketing and brand building, to
          improve consumers awareness and trust of the project products. In addition, it actively seeks cooperation with
          medical institutions, scientific research institutions and upstream and downstream enterprises of the
          industrial chain to jointly promote the clinical application and industrialization process of technology.</p>

    <h3>Main Financial Assumptions</h3>
    <p>The calculation process specifically makes the following assumptions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> (1) Full investment assumption. It is assumed that when determining the cash flow of the project, only the
        entire investment movement is considered, without distinguishing the specific forms of cash flow from the funds
        of the venture capital company. That is, make all the actual existing funds as the capital of the operation of
        the company.</li>
      <li> (2) Deterministic hypothesis. Suppose that the price, cost, and income tax rates related to the project cash
        flow are all known constants.</li>
      <li> (3) Financial feasibility analysis hypothesis. Assuming that the investment decision is from the standpoint
        of the enterprise investors, the investors determine the cash flow to conduct the feasibility study of the
        project, the project has the feasibility of national economy and technical feasibility.</li>
      <li> (4) The hypothesis of investment funds during the construction period. Whether the original investment of the
        project is one investment or two investment, it is assumed to be invested during the construction period, except
        as otherwise specified.</li>
      <li> (5) Time-point index assumptions. In order to facilitate the use of the time value of funds, whether the
        value index involved in the time index of the cash flow is the timing index; at the end of the year of the
        construction year, the income, cost, amortization, profit, tax and other items occur at the end of the year; and
        the final scrapping or liquidation of the project occurs at the endpoint.</li>
      <li> (6) Investment income analysis: According to the development plan of the company, the following objectives,
        the preparatory work of the Company shall be gradually improved in the initial construction stage to purchase
        fixed assets; since the initial operation stage, the advanced price is more reasonable than similar products;
        with the normalization of the Company, the Company shall expand production scale and reinvest.</li>
      <li> (7) Accounting system: The company implements the Accounting System for Business Enterprises.</li>
      <li> (8) Fiscal year: one fiscal year is from January 1 to December 31 of the Gregorian calendar year.</li>
      <li> (9) Accounting standard currency: RMB is the bookkeeping standard currency.</li>
      <li> (10) Accounting basis and valuation principle: take accrual basis as the accounting basis and historical cost
        as the valuation principle.</li>
      <li> (11) Depreciation of fixed assets: the plant construction is 3%; the equipment is 3% for 10 years; vehicles
        and office equipment are 5 years; the residual value is 3% and the residual value of office equipment is
        excluded.</li>
      <li> (12) Long-term amortized expenses: the companys decoration expenses are amortized by 3 years and 5 years
        respectively (the first year decoration cost is amortized by 3 years, and the fourth year decoration expenses
        are amortized by 5 years).</li>
      <li> (13) Payment receivable and employee compensation payable treatment.</li>
      <li> (14) It is estimated that the accounts receivable of the first year will be 10% of the operating income of
        the year, and the accounts receivable of the next 2-4 years will be 20% of the operating income of the year.
      </li>
      <li> (15) All expenses and employee compensation of the enterprise in the software development stage (the first
        two months) shall be paid in time, and there is no due payment. It is estimated that the accounts payable of the
        enterprise in the ten months after the first year will be 20% of the total advertising expenses and business
        entertainment expenses of the current year.</li>
      <li> (16) The annual receivables and payments payable shall be recovered and paid at the beginning of the next
        year.</li>
      <li> (17) 10% of the payable employee compensation payable shall be paid at the beginning of next year.</li>

        is expected that the intangible assets will not be impaired within five years.</li>
      <li> (20) The applicable tax (fees) and tax (fees) rates of the company are listed as follows: Company business
        tax and additional tax (5%) Corporate income tax (25%).</li>

        expenses of the website.</li>
      <li> (23) Fuel, water, electricity and alkali costs are calculated according to their annual consumption

    <h3>Analysis of financial indicators</h3>
    <h4> profitability</h4>
    <p>In the enterprise financial evaluation system, profitability is the core, which is an important content to
      measure whether the enterprise has vitality and development future. The following paper analyzes the profitability
      and operating ability of the company from the three indicators of net interest rate of total assets, net interest
      rate of sales and net interest rate of equity:</p>
    <div>
      <p>Profitability ratio analysis table</p>
      <p>
        computational method:
        <br> A. Net interest rate on sales = (net profit / sales revenue) * 100%
        <br>B. Net interest rate of total assets = (net profit / total assets) * 100%
        <br>C. Net interest rate of equity = (net profit / shareholders equity) * 100%

      </p>
      <p>
        aggregate analysis: <br>
        The net interest rate of sales can summarize all the results of the enterprise and reflect the profitability of
        the enterprise. It shows that the net interest rate can be "squeezed" between the sales revenue and its costs
        and expenses. The larger the net interest rate on sales, the stronger the profitability of the enterprise.
        According to the analysis of the companys five-year data, the companys net interest rate on sales has basically
        become an growth trend. In the fifth year, due to the increase of cost, the net interest rate on sales has
        decreased. Therefore, the company has also made an adjustment plan and developed a more suitable model for the
        development of the company.
        Net interest rate of total assets is the key to corporate earnings, which indicates the net profit created by
        each total assets. Although the return rate of shareholders is determined jointly by the rate of return on total
        assets and the financial leverage, increasing the financial leverage will increase the enterprise risk and often
        will not increase the enterprise value at the same time. In addition, there are many restrictions to the
        increase of financial leverage, and companies are often in a critical state where financial leverage is
        impossible to increase. Therefore, the basic impetus to raise the net interest rate of equity is to raise the
        net interest rate of total assets. From the companys five years of data analysis, the companys net interest rate
        of total assets is increasing year by year.

      </p>
      <p>The net interest rate of equity is the ratio of net profit to shareholders equity, which reflects the net
        profit earned by each shareholders equity and can measure the overall profitability of the enterprise. For
        shareholders and investors, it has a very good comprehensive nature, which summarizes the entire operating
        performance and financial performance of the enterprise. From the companys five-year financial data, we can see
        that the return rate of shareholders is increasing year by year.</p>

    <p>As can be seen from the above table, the proportion of current assets in total assets is 97.65%, and the
      proportion of non-current assets in total assets is 2.35%, indicating that the enterprise has strong flexibility,
      but the foundation is relatively weak, and there is no risk in the recent operation, but the long-term operation
      risk is large.</p>
    <p>The proportion of current liabilities in the total liabilities is 45.19%, indicating that enterprises are
      strongly dependent on short-term funds, and enterprises are under great pressure to repay debt in the near future.
    </p>
    <p>The liabilities of non-current assets were 54.81%, indicating that the enterprise is highly dependent on
      long-term funds in the process of operation. The long-term debt repayment pressure of enterprises is very great.

            <p>The more working capital, the more the solvency, the stronger the short-term solvency of the enterprise.
              The higher the chance of creditors recovering their claims. Therefore, the amount of working capital can
              reflect the ability to pay off the short-term debt.</p>
            <p>For the enterprise, the increase in net working capital indicates that the enterprise has strong
              short-term solvency, and the risk of short-term insolvency is low. Compared with the beginning of the
              year, the working capital has increased by 122,140.2 yuan, indicating that the working capital situation
              of the enterprise continues to rise, further reducing the risk of insolvency.</p>

          </li>
          <li>
            <h6>2. Current ratio analysis</h6>
            <p>The current ratio is a more commonly used ratio to evaluate the solvency of enterprises. It can measure
              the size of the short-term solvency of enterprises.</p>
            <p>For creditors, the higher the ratio, the better. A high ratio means that the ability to repay the
              short-term debt is strong, and the debt is guaranteed. For the owner, this ratio should not be too high.
              The high ratio indicates that a large amount of funds are overstocked in the form of current assets held,
              which affects the high-speed operation in the production and operation process and affects the efficiency
              of the use of funds. If the ratio is too low, it means that the ability to repay short-term debt is low,
              which affects the financing ability of enterprises, and is bound to affect the smooth development of
              production and operation activities.</p>
            <p>When the current ratio is greater than 2, it means that the solvency of the enterprise is strong. When
              the current ratio is less than 2, it means that the solvency of the enterprise is weak. When the current
              ratio is equal to 1, it means that the solvency of the enterprise is more dangerous. When the current
              ratio is less than 1, it means that the solvency of the enterprise is very difficult.</p>
            <p>Our company, the current ratio is 4.54, according to the general recognized standards, indicating that
              the solvency of the enterprise is strong, and the short-term solvency is further enhanced compared with
              the previous year.</p>

            <h6>3. Quick ratio analysis</h6>
            <p>Although the current ratio can be used to evaluate the overall liquidity of current assets, it is also
              hoped that, especially short-term creditors, will obtain a further ratio indicator of liquidity than the
              liquidity ratio. This is the quick ratio.</p>
            <p>The normal quick ratio is usually considered to be 1, and the quick ratio lower than 1 is considered that
              the enterprise faces a great debt repayment risk. The important factor affecting the credibility of the
              speed ratio is the liquidity of accounts receivable. The accounts receivable on the book may not always be
              cash, the actual bad debts may be more than the provision; so the evaluation quick ratio should be
              combined with the accounts receivable turnover rate. The quick ratio is the same as the current ratio,
              which reflects the final situation and does not represent the long-term debt situation of the enterprise.
            </p>
            <p>The quick ratio of the enterprise is 4.64. For the accepted standards, the short-term solvency of the
              enterprise is relatively strong.</p>
            <p>Further analysis of the reasons for our companys strong solvency can be seen that the proportion of the
              companys monetary capital in the total assets is relatively high, and the excessive occupation of the
              companys monetary capital will greatly increase the opportunity cost of the enterprise.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h6>4. Cash rate analysis</h6>
            <p>The cash ratio is the balance of the quick assets after deducting accounts receivable. The amount
              calculated by the quick assets after deducting the accounts receivable can best reflect the ability of the
              enterprise to directly repay the current liabilities. The cash ratio is generally considered better at
              more than 20%. However, this ratio is too high, which means that the current assets of enterprises have
              not been used reasonably, and the profitability of cash assets is low. The high amount of such assets will
              lead to the increase of the opportunity cost of enterprises.</p>
            <p>As can be seen from the above table, the cash ratio is 0.46, which is much higher than the general
              standard of 20%, indicating that the enterprise has a good ability to directly repay the current
              liabilities, but the working capital has not been fully utilized.</p>

        <p>computational method:
          <br> A. Asset-liability ratio = total liabilities / total assets

          <li>
            <h6>1. Asset-liability ratio</h6>
            <p>The asset-liability ratio reflects the comprehensive ability of the enterprise to repay debts, and the
              higher the ratio is, the worse the ability to repay debts; on the contrary, the ability to repay debts is
              stronger.</p>
            <p>It is generally believed that the appropriate level of the asset-liability ratio is 0.4-0.6. For
              enterprises with relatively high operating risk, relatively low asset-liability ratio is selected to
              reduce financial risk; for enterprises with low operating risk, relatively high asset-liability ratio
              should be selected to increase shareholder income.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h6>2. Property ratio</h6>
            <p>The ratio of property rights not only reflects the relative relationship between the capital provided by
              the debtor and the capital provided by the owner, but also reflects the ability of the enterprises own
              funds to repay all the debts. Therefore, it is an important indicator to measure the safety of the
              enterprises debt operation. Generally speaking, the lower the ratio indicates that the stronger the
              long-term solvency of the enterprise, the higher the protection degree of creditors rights and interests,
              and the smaller the risk borne. Generally, it is believed that this ratio is within 1, that is, below 1,
              which should be solvent, but it should also be analyzed according to the specific situation of the
              enterprise. When the return on assets of an enterprise is greater than the liability cost rate, the debt
              operation is conducive to improving the return on capital and obtaining additional profits, then the
              property right ratio can be appropriately higher, which is the financial structure of high risk and high
              remuneration; the low property right ratio is the financial structure with low risk and low remuneration.

    <ul>
      <li>1. Business cycle refers to how long it takes to convert all the ending inventory into cash. The short
        business cycle indicates that the capital turnover speed is fast and the normal flow ratio is low. We can see
        from Table 2-4 that the business cycle of GCSSC is short and the inventory liquidity is strong.</li>
      <li>
        <p>2. Inventory turnover rate is the ratio of the sales cost of goods to the average inventory in a certain
          period of time. It is an indicator to measure the realization speed of the companys inventory, the companys
          sales ability and whether the inventory is excessive. Generally, the higher the inventory turnover rate, the
          stronger the liquidity or liquidity of the companys inventory, the higher the sales or turnover, and the
          higher the profitability. The calculation formula is: inventory turnover rate = cost of sales / average
          inventory.</p>
        <p>As can be seen from the table, the inventory turnover rate of the company has been at a relatively stable
          level in the past three years, with a small range of change, and the inventory turnover speed is relatively
          fast.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          3. The turnover rate of accounts receivable is an important indicator of an enterprise. Even the recovery of
          accounts receivable can not only enhance the short-term solvency of an enterprise, but also reflect the
          efficiency of the enterprise in managing accounts receivable.
        </p>
        <p>As can be seen from Table 2.4, the companys receivables recovery rate was the fastest in the second year,
          8.8% faster than in 2008 and 25.26% faster than in the first year. This is mainly due to the companys
          strengthening of management and improving work efficiency, resulting in the increase of the main business
          income and the decrease of accounts receivable, and thus accelerating the recovery speed of accounts
          receivable.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>4. The turnover rate of current assets refers to the number of turnover of current assets in a certain period
          of time and the number of days required for one turnover of goods. It is mainly an important index to measure
          the turnover rate of current assets, and can reflect the utilization efficiency of all current assets. The
          calculation formula is as follows: turnover rate of current assets = sales income / average balance of current
          assets.</p>
        <p>Accordingly, it is concluded that the companys current assets turnover rate for three years is 0.79,0.78 and
          0.80, respectively. It can be seen that the companys current asset turnover rate is the fastest in the second
          year, but compared with the change is not obvious. It can be seen that the utilization efficiency of current
          assets is relatively high, and the annual change is stable.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>5. Total asset turnover is the ratio of the companys sales revenue to the average total assets, which is
          mainly used to evaluate the operating efficiency of all assets. According to the definition, the total asset
          turnover rates in the third year, the second year and the first year are 0.65,0.66 and 0.64, respectively.
          According to the income statement, the sales revenue in the past three years is at a stable level, and the
          operating efficiency of assets is relatively good.</p>
        <p>Comprehensive analysis can be seen that the companys current operating situation is better, and showed a
          trend of improving year by year, the company should continue the rising momentum, improve the efficiency of
          using the economic resources, including the enterprise assets turnover speed and utilization efficiency of
          human resources, to make the enterprise more effective use of assets, make more profits.</p>

    <p>computational method:
      <br> A. Payback period = cumulative net present value positive years-1 + (unpaid cash / current year present
      value)
      <br> B. Investment payback period = 2+12515213.80/6296312.20=2.2 That is, the investment payback period is two
      years and three months, and the investment plan is feasible.
    </p>


    <h4> Net present value of investment</h4>
    <p>Net present value of the Project investment:</p>
    <img class="rounded mx-auto d-block" style="width: 300px;" src="static/entrepreneurship/formula1.webp" alt="formula1">
    <p>Considering the current low cost of capital, as well as the opportunity cost of capital in the same industry and
      the risk of investment and other factors, I takes 10% (the same below), at this time, NPV = 2012 (10,000 yuan),
      much greater than zero. The profitability during the calculation period is very good, and the investment plan is
      feasible.p>



    <h4>Inclusion rate of remuneration</h4>
    <p>The embedded remuneration rate calculated in the cash flow statement is as follows:</p>
    <img class="rounded mx-auto d-block" style="width: 300px;" src="static/entrepreneurship/formula2.webp" alt="formula1">
    <p>
      The embedded return rate reaches 12%, which is greater than the capital cost rate of 10% and greater than the
      embedded return rate of 8% in the same industry, mainly because of the high quality and low price of the product,
      the sales profit margin is high. Moreover, the market growth in the first five years is very good.

    </p>


    <h4> overall merit</h4>
    <p>
      Through the investigation of the above evaluation indicators, the following conditions are also met:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>(1) Net present value NPV> 0</li>
      <li>(2) Inclusion of return rate IRR> 10% (capital cost rate)</li>
      <li>(3) The investment payback period is &lt;3 years</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It can be concluded that the investment project has financial feasibility in any aspect, and the investment
      project should be accepted.</p>
