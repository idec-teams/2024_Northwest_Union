    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>  Our team prioritizes experimental safety and risk control in all our projects and actions, as safety is of utmost importance. We incorporate safety considerations throughout the project lifecycle, including experimental design, implementation, and future impacts. We adhere strictly to national and relevant institutional safety regulations to ensure the integrity of our experiments, and we have experienced instructors on hand to help us manage risks effectively.

    <h2>Organism</h2>
    <hr>
    <p> The microorganism we use is ECN1917, which is considered a low-risk organism for humans and the environment. At the same time, we strictly adhere to safety guidelines for microbiological experiments to ensure that the microorganisms we use do not spread. </p>

    <h2>Part</h2>
    <hr>
    
    <p>We have developed a vesicular delivery system composed of DLPC membranes that can significantly enhance the safety of probiotic delivery. By precisely modulating the release timing and dosage of probiotics, we can minimize potential irritation and side effects. Furthermore, this optimized expression system may reduce the immune system's recognition of foreign probiotics, thereby alleviating excessive immune responses. The vesicular structure also effectively inhibits the proliferation of engineered bacteria, ensuring biosafety. Additionally, the enhanced targeting capability allows probiotics to effectively reach specific organs, such as the liver and pancreas, thus minimizing their impact on other tissues and further improving overall safety. In the future, this system can be tailored to meet the individual needs of patients, facilitating more precise treatment while reducing the risk of adverse reactions.</p>

    <h2>Conditions</h2>
    <hr>
    
    <p>First and foremost, with regard to experimental conditions, our laboratory is equipped with sufficient, accredited, and secure facilities to facilitate and ensure the successful conduct of our experiments. We operate a standard level 1 microbiological laboratory designated for the manipulation of low-risk microorganisms, such as *Escherichia coli*, which includes an ultra-clean workstation and essential protective equipment, including disposable masks and gloves. In addition, we have a range of specialized and safe experimental equipment to support our research endeavors. Furthermore, we have established a moderate containment laboratory specifically designed for experiments that necessitate elevated aseptic and safety standards, featuring a professional biosafety cabinet. To enhance personal protective measures, our laboratory provides an ample supply of disposable medical gloves and masks for all personnel, thereby significantly mitigating the risks associated with microbial inhalation and direct exposure to hazardous substances. We have also placed prominent signs at the entrance of our laboratory to ensure that all personnel can clearly understand the safety regulations and relevant precaution</p>

    <h2>Risk Management</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Our laboratory has established comprehensive risk control measures, equipped with sufficient emergency medical kits to provide timely treatment for personnel in the event of exposure to hazardous substances or other injuries. The laboratory walls are adorned with numerous reminders of safety protocols and standards, aimed at continuously reinforcing the safety awareness of all experimental personnel. Additionally, safety guidelines and emergency contact numbers for the safety center are prominently displayed on the outer walls to ensure that all individuals entering the facility can quickly access relevant information.</p>
    <p>To ensure routine personal protection, our laboratory provides an ample supply of disposable medical gloves and masks, thereby effectively reducing the risk of inhaling microorganisms. Access to the entire laboratory building is strictly regulated; individuals wishing to enter must use their activated campus cards, which will not function unless they have submitted an application and received approval from the Lab Safety Center. The keys to our specific laboratory are managed by designated personnel, with access limited to authorized team members to ensure the safety of the research environment.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, our laboratory implements a stringent and standardized management system for hazardous chemicals and microorganisms. We have designated storage spaces that are clearly marked with warning signs to enhance safety and compliance. The keys to access these areas are also securely managed by designated personnel to further ensure the effective implementation of safety management practices.</p>

    <h2>Laboratory Access Security</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>IAccess to the entire laboratory building is strictly regulated; individuals seeking entry must utilize their activated campus cards, which will not function otherwise. Only those who have submitted applications and received approval from the laboratory safety center are eligible to activate their campus cards. The keys to access our specific laboratory are securely managed by designated personnel. Consequently, entry is restricted solely to authorized team members, thereby ensuring a controlled and secure environment for our research activities.</p>

    <h2>Experimental training</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Before commencing any experiments, all team members undergo comprehensive training in essential laboratory skills. This training encompasses a range of competencies, including but not limited to bacterial inoculation techniques, the proper use of sterilization equipment, and protocols for personal protective measures. Such preparation significantly mitigates the risks associated with microbial exposure to human health. On the final day of training, our supervisor conducts assessments to evaluate each individual's proficiency. Those who do not meet the required standards must continue their studies until they successfully demonstrate their competence, at which point they are permitted to access the laboratory.</p>
